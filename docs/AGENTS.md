# AGENTS.md - TF2 FinOps CDO Documentation Builder

## Purpose

This repository contains the client brief and reusable document templates for Task Force 2, "FinOps Watch". Future agents must use this file when creating the CDO documentation pack for the task force.

The goal is to produce a bilingual CDO documentation pack under `docs/tf2-finops/` (English and Vietnamese) that explains how the CDO platform operates the FinOps data/control plane, integrates with the AIOps-owned AI Engine, routes alerts, enforces safe containment, and maintains finance-readable evidence.

## Source Priority

Use sources in this order:

1. Signed contracts in `docs/contracts/` (binding sources of truth, above all templates and other docs):
   - `docs/contracts/ai-api-contract.md` (v1.4.0)
   - `docs/contracts/deployment-contract.md` (v1.3.0)
   - `docs/contracts/telemetry-contract.md` (v3.2.0)
2. `TF2_FINOPS_LEARNER.md` - client brief and hard requirements.
3. Explicit user or client updates in the current conversation.
4. `template-docs/` - reusable structure and baseline section ideas.
5. Agent improvements, only when they do not contradict the sources above.

Do not overwrite files in `template-docs/`. Treat them as templates only.

## Scope

Create CDO documentation only. The docs may reference AI Engine contracts, anomaly metrics, backtest outputs, and alert payloads where needed for platform integration, but they must not invent AI model internals or replace the AIOps team's own documentation.

In scope:

- Requirements analysis for the CDO platform.
- Infrastructure design.
- Security design.
- Deployment and CI/CD design.
- Cost analysis.
- Finance-friendly dashboard and alert routing design.
- CDO test and evaluation report.
- Architecture Decision Records.
- Demo and presentation support document.

Out of scope unless the user explicitly expands scope:

- Full AI engine implementation spec.
- Multi-cloud design.
- Forecasting or budget planning product design.
- RI/SP recommendation engine or auto-trading.
- CloudHealth, Apptio, Vantage, or other third-party FinOps platform integration.
- Real AWS bill access.
- Self-service tenant onboarding UI.

## Default Architecture Choices

Use these defaults unless the user provides different decisions:

- Languages: English (primary) and Vietnamese (translation). Each document has two versions.
- Output folder: `docs/tf2-finops/`.
- Architecture angle: lakehouse-centric FinOps control plane with serverless orchestration and AIOps-owned AI Engine integration.
- AWS Region: `ap-southeast-1` for examples.
- Cadence decision: 24h default, defended as the middle trade-off between data freshness, Cost Explorer/CUR lag, operational cost, and false-positive control.
- Data sources: AWS Data Exports/CUR 2.0 or CUR in S3 (default source of truth) plus Cost Explorer API (conditional fallback only when `telemetry_delay_event = true`).
- Data lake: S3 raw and curated zones, Glue Data Catalog, Athena views, and governed prefixes for cost, ownership, anomaly, alert, containment, and audit datasets. AWS Glue schemas are managed in Terraform and utilize client-side Athena Partition Projection to avoid Glue Crawler runtime costs (ADR-014).
- Orchestration: EventBridge Scheduler triggers Step Functions Standard workflows.
- AI integration: CDO hosts the AIOps-provided AI Engine on AWS Lambda container images running in private subnets, fronted by a private Application Load Balancer (ALB) or target group exposing the private `/v1/*` HTTPS endpoints. CDO owns the hosting platform, ECR image deployment by digest, Lambda execution roles, reserved concurrency, private internal networking, monitoring, and platform SLOs; AIOps owns the Lambda-compatible AI Engine container image, model code, detection logic, explanation text, and backtest metrics.
- AI Engine runtime: Lambda container image in `ap-southeast-1`, private VPC integration, ECR for container images, Lambda execution roles, Secrets Manager integration. The runtime is exposed behind a private ALB or equivalent private HTTPS adapter that exposes `/v1/detect`, `/v1/decide`, `/v1/verify`, `/v1/status/{id}`, `/v1/audit/{audit_id}/rollback`, and `/health`.
- Security & Integrity Controls: All requests between CDO and AI Engine utilize AWS SigV4 authentication. CDO sends, and AI Engine validates, cross-cutting headers: `X-Tenant-Id` (`tenant_id`), `X-Idempotency-Key` (`idempotency_key`), `X-Payload-SHA256` (`payload_sha256`), `X-Request-Timestamp` (`request_timestamp`), and `X-Dry-Run-Mode`.
- Lambda concurrency guardrails: Lambda reserved concurrency (e.g., 5-10 concurrent executions baseline) to control blast radius and throttle limits, with Provisioned Concurrency only as a production optimization if cold-start latency demands it (e.g., Provisioned Concurrency = 2).
- Ingestion execution path: Private HTTPS requests to the ALB target group / Lambda endpoint. SQS queues (and DLQ) are reserved only for alert routing retry buffers.
- Data store: S3/Object Lock is the authoritative audit and telemetry store, and stores rollback evidence; DynamoDB is the hot path for scheduled run idempotency (table `finops-idempotency-{env}` with conditional writes and 24h TTL) and rollback caching (table `finops-rollback-cache` with 90-day TTL).
- Primary bucket name convention: `company-cdo-{account_id}-telemetry` (account-scoped, replacing any global `tf2-cdo` patterns).
- Analytics storage/query: S3, Glue Data Catalog, Athena, and materialized dashboard tables/views where needed. Schemas are validated with Athena SQL DDL before promotion into Terraform definitions with Athena Partition Projection (ADR-014).
- Operational metadata: S3 authoritative store for run state, anomaly records, routing state, and containment audit records; DynamoDB tables serve as a dashboard materialized read cache, idempotency hot path, and rollback cache.
- Dashboard: QuickSight or a lightweight internal web dashboard backed by S3 JSON summaries and Athena/DynamoDB cache views.
- Alerting: separate Finance and Engineering channels, such as email/Slack/SNS targets, with routing based on anomaly type and ownership tags.
- Containment posture: dry-run first, safe automation only for non-prod/dev/sandbox resources. Enforce `LOCKED_MODE` at the CDO platform level (disabled execution) if rollback error budget thresholds are breached (prod: 1%, staging: 10%).

## CDO vs AIOps Responsibility Boundary

Use this boundary in every generated document:

- CDO owns cost data ingestion, normalized cost windows, ownership/tag metadata, scheduling, idempotency table management, workflow state, dashboard views, alert routing, containment guardrails, audit logs, platform operational SLOs, and the private Lambda container hosting platform for the AI Engine (Lambda functions behind private ALB, execution roles, reserved concurrency, ECR digest deployment, networking, and platform SLOs). CDO also owns and executes containment rollbacks via boto3 directly, independent of AI availability.
- AIOps owns anomaly detection logic, model selection, model training/retraining design, model versioning, confidence scoring, anomaly classification, explanation text, AI Engine code and model internals, and AI backtest metrics. AIOps provides versioned container artifacts (Lambda-compatible ECR container images, weights, configs); CDO deploys and operates them on AWS Lambda behind the private ALB.
- CDO consumes the AI Engine through a versioned programmatic contract via private HTTPS requests to `/v1/*` endpoints. CDO must document request/response fields, authentication (SigV4), integrity headers, timeout, retry, circuit-breaker, unavailable-AI fallback, evidence storage, and the Lambda container operations runbook.
- CDO must not claim responsibility for AI precision/recall internals. It may report AI metrics only as AIOps-provided integration evidence.
- If AI Engine is unavailable, CDO must fail closed for containment: no automatic apply action, alert operators, preserve the failed run, and write an audit record.
- CDO caches `rollback_payload.boto3_equivalent` in DynamoDB table `finops-rollback-cache` immediately after receiving a `/v1/decide` response. Rollback execution is performed via CDO-owned boto3 client operations, ensuring it never depends on AI Engine availability. The `finops-watch-rollback` SQS queue is used solely for audit completion notification, not for triggering rollback commands.
- CDO must not claim responsibility for AI precision/recall internals. It may report AI metrics only as AIOps-provided integration evidence.
- If AI Engine is unavailable, CDO must fail closed for containment: no automatic apply action, alert operators, preserve the failed run, and write an audit record.

## Client Hard Requirements

Every generated document must respect these requirements from `TF2_FINOPS_LEARNER.md`:

- AWS only.
- Synthetic data only unless the user provides real bill access.
- Backtest target: precision >=80% and false-positive rate <=10% over 3 months.
- Time frame goal must be one of 12h, 24h, or 48h and defended in ADRs.
- NEVER terminate prod, delete data, or modify IAM.
- Auto-action on prod is limited to tag, suggest, or dry-run.
- Implement at least one containment pattern and design at least two more.
- dry-run mode is mandatory for all containment paths.
- Audit trail is mandatory for every containment action.
- Audit retention must be at least 90 days.
- Dashboard must be finance-readable and must not require SQL knowledge.
- Demo path must show synthetic anomaly injection, detection, alerting, and containment action trigger.

For every containment action, document:

- Actor.
- Timestamp.
- Correlation ID.
- Idempotency key.
- Anomaly ID.
- Resource/account/squad owner.
- Before state.
- Proposed or applied after state.
- Execution mode: `dry-run` or `apply`.
- Rollback path.
- Approval status when human approval is required.
- Retention location and retention period.

## Required Output Catalog

Create or update these files under `docs/tf2-finops/`. Every document must be produced in two versions:

- **English version**: uses the base filename (e.g., `02_infra_design.md`).
- **Vietnamese version**: appends `_vi` before the extension (e.g., `02_infra_design_vi.md`).

The Vietnamese version is a full translation of the English version, not a summary or subset. Both versions must contain identical structure, sections, diagrams, tables, and technical detail. See the **Bilingual Translation Rules** section for translation standards.

Each document below lists the **exact heading structure** the agent must produce. Headings use numbered sections matching the template-docs convention. The agent must use these exact section titles (adapted to the FinOps CDO context where the template uses generic placeholders). Content guidance follows each heading.

- Keep technical sections specific enough for DevOps/CDO reviewers.
- Use Mermaid diagrams where they clarify architecture, sequence, or controls.
- Preserve client boundaries even if a template suggests a broader platform feature.
- Avoid placeholders such as `TBD`, `TODO`, `<fill>`, `<N>`, or `<M>` in final docs.

## Bilingual Translation Rules

Apply these rules when producing the Vietnamese (`_vi`) version of each document:

- The Vietnamese file must be a complete, faithful translation of the English file, preserving all sections, headings, tables, diagrams, code blocks, and technical detail.
- Keep AWS service names, technical terms, and proper nouns in English (e.g., "Lambda", "Step Functions", "EventBridge Scheduler", "CUR", "Athena", "DynamoDB", "QuickSight", "dry-run", "lakehouse-centric").
- Keep acronyms in English (e.g., CDO, AIOps, IAM, CI/CD, IaC, SLO, ADR, OIDC).
- Keep code snippets, CLI commands, file paths, and Mermaid diagram syntax in English.
- Translate all prose, explanations, section headings, bullet-point descriptions, table headers, and table cell descriptions into natural Vietnamese.
- Use Vietnamese technical vocabulary where widely accepted (e.g., "kiến trúc" for architecture, "triển khai" for deployment, "bảo mật" for security, "chi phí" for cost, "cảnh báo" for alert, "bảng điều khiển" for dashboard).
- Currency references remain in USD; add "(đô la Mỹ)" on first occurrence if helpful.
- Maintain the same heading hierarchy and numbering as the English version.
- The Vietnamese title of each document should include the Vietnamese translation followed by the English title in parentheses for cross-reference. Example: `# Thiết kế Hạ tầng (Infrastructure Design)`.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder content compared to the English version.
- `Evidence needed: ...` markers should be translated as `Cần bằng chứng: ...`.

## Suggested Data Contracts To Reference

The client brief requires three contracts signed with the CDO group. For CDO docs, reference these as integration contracts unless the user asks to write the contracts themselves:

1. Cost data pull contract
   - Owner: CDO.
   - Source: CUR in S3 and Cost Explorer API.
   - Trigger: scheduled CDO pull by cadence.
   - Key fields: account, service, region, tag owner, environment, cost amount, usage date, cost period, currency USD.

2. AI decision output contract
   - Owner: AIOps.
   - Source: AIOps-owned AI Engine after anomaly detection.
   - CDO responsibility: consume this contract, validate required fields, persist evidence, route alerts, and enforce containment policy.
   - Key fields: run ID, model version, anomaly ID, tenant/account, anomaly type, confidence, severity, expected spend, actual spend, delta, evidence window, explanation, recommended route, recommended containment mode, evidence URI.

3. Alert and containment contract
   - Owner: CDO.
   - Source: CDO alert/containment workflow.
   - Key fields: anomaly ID, route target, approval requirement, action type, execution mode, before state, after state, rollback path, audit record ID.

## Review Checklist

Before considering the document pack complete, verify:

- All required English files exist under `docs/tf2-finops/`.
- All required Vietnamese (`_vi`) files exist under `docs/tf2-finops/`.
- Every Vietnamese file is a complete translation of its English counterpart (same sections, same structure).
- `template-docs/` was not overwritten.
- The English docs mention `lakehouse-centric`.
- The English docs mention `AIOps-owned AI Engine`.
- The English docs mention `Lambda container image`.
- The English docs mention `ECR image digest pinning` and `reserved concurrency`.
- The English docs mention async queues and SQS (for alerts retry, not invocation).
- The English docs mention `EventBridge Scheduler`.
- The English docs mention `CUR` as source of truth and `Athena`.
- The English docs mention `dry-run`.
- The English docs mention `90 days` or `>=90 days` audit retention.
- The English docs include the exact hard boundary: `NEVER terminate prod, delete data, or modify IAM`.
- The Vietnamese docs preserve these same terms in English where required by translation rules.
- The docs define 12h, 24h, or 48h cadence and defend the chosen value.
- The docs include finance-readable dashboard requirements.
- The docs include separate Finance and Engineering alert routing.
- The docs include idempotency for scheduled cost-period processing using DynamoDB `finops-idempotency-{env}` with conditional writes and 24h TTL.
- The docs include the primary bucket naming convention `company-cdo-{account_id}-telemetry`.
- The docs include at least one implemented containment pattern and at least two designed containment patterns.
- The docs include CDO-owned offline rollback using cached `boto3_equivalent` payloads in DynamoDB `finops-rollback-cache` when the AI Engine is unavailable.
- The docs do not fabricate measured results.
- Placeholder scan returns no accidental template markers:

```powershell
rg -n "TBD|TODO|<N>|<M>|<fill>|placeholder" docs/tf2-finops AGENTS.md
```

Verify both English and Vietnamese files exist:

```powershell
# Check English files
Get-ChildItem docs/tf2-finops/*.md | Where-Object { $_.Name -notmatch '_vi\.md$' } | Select-Object Name

# Check Vietnamese files
Get-ChildItem docs/tf2-finops/*_vi.md | Select-Object Name

# Ensure counts match (9 English + 9 Vietnamese = 18 total)
(Get-ChildItem docs/tf2-finops/*.md).Count
```

Run this stale-assumption scan (should return no results outside historical context):

```powershell
rg -n "direct synchronous Lambda|direct Lambda equivalent|AWS Lambda Function URL|No Private API Gateway|s3://tf2-cdo|tf2-cdo\{NN\}|S3-based audit and idempotency|s3://company-cdo-telemetry/" AGENTS.md docs/tf2-finops
```

Run this contract-term coverage scan:

```powershell
rg -n "company-cdo-|finops-idempotency-|DynamoDB conditional write|ttl_expiry|business_context|traffic_volume|cost_per_request|telemetry_delay_event|missing_resources|current_ce_cost_gap_usd|SigV4|X-Payload-SHA256|X-Request-Timestamp|LOCKED_MODE|boto3_equivalent|finops-watch-rollback" AGENTS.md docs/tf2-finops
```

Verify contract version references:

```powershell
rg -n "ai-api-contract.md.*v1.4.0|deployment-contract.md.*v1.3.0|telemetry-contract.md.*v3.2.0" AGENTS.md docs/tf2-finops
```
