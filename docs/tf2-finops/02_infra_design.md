## 1. Architecture diagram

The CDO platform is designed around a lakehouse-centric data plane for ingest and analysis, orchestrated by serverless workflows, and integrated with an AIOps-owned AI Engine hosted on a managed EKS cluster. The EKS compute tier uses a hybrid configuration of on-demand and spot node groups to optimize execution costs.

The architecture is sized around recurring CDO platform responsibilities, not around the AIOps model-training dataset. CDO must reliably pull billing data from approved AWS sources, normalize it into a contract-ready shape, invoke the AIOps-owned AI Engine, and preserve the returned decision evidence. Any synthetic historical dataset used to train, enhance, or backtest the model remains AIOps-owned.

*Caption: The CDO pipeline is triggered daily by EventBridge Scheduler. The Step Functions workflow coordinates ingestion from member accounts, writes raw CUR and Cost Explorer data to S3, and catalogs it. The workflow requests anomaly detection from the AIOps-owned AI Engine via the EKS internal ALB. The EKS cluster isolates stable APIs on an on-demand node group and batch-scoring/training tasks on a cost-optimized spot node group. Dashboard views and containment workflows pull clean state from Athena and DynamoDB.*

---

To provide a clearer view of the CDO platform's operations, the overall architecture is broken down into a high-level overview followed by three detailed zoom-in diagrams below:

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture Overview

This diagram represents the high-level macro interactions between the central orchestrator, the lakehouse data plane, the EKS compute cluster, and the alerting/containment engines.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Member Accounts"
        Members[AWS Resources & Cost Exports]
    end

    subgraph "CDO Management Account"
        SF[Step Functions Orchestrator] -->|1. Pull Data| Lakehouse[(S3 Lakehouse & Athena)]
        Lakehouse -->|2. Ingested Cost Data| SF
        SF -->|3. Invoke AI Inference| EKS[EKS Cluster: AI Engine]
        EKS -->|4. Anomaly Decision| SF
        SF -->|5. Contain & Alert| Actions[Alerting & Containment Engine]
    end

    Actions -->|6. Apply Policy| Members
    Actions -->|7. Publish| Dashboard[Finance Dashboard / Channels]
```

*Caption: The central Step Functions Orchestrator drives the entire FinOps loop: extracting data to the Lakehouse, calling the EKS-hosted AI Engine for anomaly decisions, and invoking alerting and containment workflows based on the results.*

Operationally, Step Functions is the control boundary between deterministic CDO logic and probabilistic AI output. Every transition records a `run_id`, cost window, account scope, and contract version so that Finance can trace a dashboard anomaly back to the exact ingestion batch and AI decision. This design also prevents the AI Engine from directly touching member accounts; all alerting and containment actions are mediated by CDO policy workers.

### 1.2 Ingestion & Data Lakehouse Workflow

This diagram zooms in on the ingestion pipeline and the lakehouse storage/query layers.

```mermaid

        Puller -->|Copy CUR Files| CUR
        Puller -->|2. Write Raw| RawS3[(S3 Raw Zone)]

    end
    
    classDef external fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class CUR,CE external;
```

*Caption: Step Functions invokes the Ingestion Lambda daily via EventBridge Scheduler. Raw cost data from Member Accounts is stored in the S3 Raw Zone, transitioned and cataloged into Parquet format in the S3 Curated Zone, and made queryable via Athena. The query results are passed back to the Step Functions orchestrator to feed the AI Engine.*

The ingestion workflow normalizes the two operational billing shapes before invoking the AI Engine. CUR provides resource-level fields such as account ID, product code, resource ID, unblended cost, and resource tags. Cost Explorer provides aggregate fields such as linked account, service name, service code, region, unblended cost, and estimated/final status. The curated layer keeps both normalized service code and display-name fields so CDO can pass consistent payloads to AIOps and build dashboard views without taking ownership of model training data.

### 1.3 AI Engine EKS Hosting Platform

This diagram zooms in on the EKS cluster layout, illustrating the separation of stable API nodes (On-Demand) from batch-processing and retraining nodes (Spot).

        end
    end
    
    subgraph "Central Registry & Secrets"
        ECR[Amazon ECR]
        SM[Secrets Manager]
    end

    %% Flow

    API -->|6. Return Confidence & Explanation| SF
    
    Core -->|ESO sync key| SM
    API -.->|Pull Image| ECR
    Worker -.->|Pull Image| ECR
```

*Caption: The AI Engine `/detect` request from the Step Functions orchestrator is routed via the Internal ALB to the `ai-engine-api` running on On-Demand nodes. Heavy-duty jobs are coordinated on Spot nodes to read/write curated features from S3. Credentials and configurations are synced from Secrets Manager using the External Secrets Operator (ESO).*

The EKS platform separates runtime reliability from cost-efficient batch execution. `ai-engine-api` and `ai-engine-explainer` remain on on-demand nodes because Step Functions depends on predictable response behavior during the daily run. `ai-engine-worker`, batch scoring jobs, feature engineering jobs, and retraining jobs are placed on spot nodes because they can checkpoint to S3 and retry after interruption. This distinction is required for both cost control and accurate failure recovery.

### 1.4 Alerting & Containment Engine

This diagram zooms in on the alerting and containment flow, detailing how policy is enforced safely across production and non-production environments with a compliance audit trail.

```mermaid

        SF -->|2. Execute Policy| ContLambda[Containment Lambda]
        
        StateLambda[State Lambda] -->|Read/Write Run Lock| StateDB[(DynamoDB Run State)]
        SF -->|Query State| StateLambda
        
        ContLambda -->|Write Audit Record| AuditDB[(DynamoDB Audit Trail)]
        ContLambda -->|3. Tag/Shutdown| DevSand
        ContLambda -->|4. Dry-Run / Tag Only| Prod
    end

    subgraph "Channels & Presentation"
        AlertLambda -->|Slack Alert| Slack[Slack Channels]
        AlertLambda -->|Email Alert| SES[SES / Email Targets]
        Dashboard[QuickSight Finance Dashboard] -->|Athena Views| AuditDB
    end
```

*Caption: The Step Functions workflow triggers separate alerting and containment Lambdas based on the AI Engine's decisions. Containment Lambdas read run state, write audit logs to DynamoDB, apply active containment (tag/shutdown) on Dev/Sandbox accounts, and execute dry-run actions (tag/suggest only) on Prod. QuickSight presents spend and containment status directly to Finance stakeholders.*

The containment engine treats `execution_mode` as a mandatory policy input, not a runtime convenience. Production resources can only receive tag, suggest, or dry-run outcomes, while dev/sandbox resources may receive apply-mode actions only when policy and approval requirements are satisfied. Each proposed or executed action writes an audit record before attempting any member-account operation.

The component model maps directly to the three data contracts used by the platform:

| Contract | CDO component responsible | Minimum evidence retained |
|---|---|---|
| Cost data pull contract | EventBridge Scheduler, Step Functions, Ingestion Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena | Source object URI, cost window, account, service, region, tag owner, unblended cost, estimated/final flag. |
| AI decision output contract | Internal ALB, `ai-engine-api`, Step Functions, DynamoDB | Model version, anomaly ID, confidence, severity, expected vs actual spend, evidence window, explanation, recommended route. |
| Alert and containment contract | Alert Lambda, Containment Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 audit trail | Route target, approval requirement, execution mode, before/after state, rollback path, audit record ID. |

---

## 3. Differentiation angle deep-dive

### 3.1 Why this angle?

The CDO platform implements a **lakehouse-centric FinOps control plane with serverless orchestration and EKS hybrid hosting for the AI Engine**.
1. **Lakehouse Fit**: Production FinOps operates on a natural 24h cadence dictated by AWS CUR export frequencies. A lakehouse pattern (S3 + Glue + Athena) avoids the high fixed costs of an always-on data warehouse (like Redshift) or relational databases, while keeping historical cost data fully structured, audit-ready, and partition-queried.
2. **Serverless Orchestration**: EventBridge and Step Functions manage the flow serverless-first, keeping the operational overhead of the pipeline orchestrator near zero.
3. **EKS Hybrid Compute for AI**: The AIOps-provided AI Engine contains two distinct workloads:
   - Stable inference endpoints (`ai-engine-api`, `ai-engine-explainer`) that must remain highly available and low-latency.
   - Heavy batch jobs (`ai-engine-worker` for feature engineering, batch scoring, and model retraining) that are computationally intensive but interruptible.
   Hosting the AI Engine on EKS enables the CDO to place stable APIs on **on-demand managed node groups** to guarantee SLOs, and batch workers on **spot node groups** with automatic node selectors and tolerations. This achieves a 60-70% reduction in AI compute cost. Fargate does not support this level of granular node-affinity control, while a pure serverless container model would lead to idle compute wastes during non-run hours.

The practical reason this matters is operational independence. AIOps can iterate on model logic, feature engineering, and false-positive handling without changing the CDO workflow. CDO keeps the lakehouse, scheduler, API invocation path, alert routing, and containment policy stable, while the EKS-hosted AI Engine can evolve behind a versioned contract.

### 3.2 Strengths (with metrics)

The metrics below highlight the trade-offs of the lakehouse-centric + EKS hybrid architecture compared to alternative CDO approaches:

| Axis | Chosen Angle (Lakehouse + EKS Hybrid) | Alternative A (ECS Fargate + RDS Aurora) | Alternative B (Third-Party SaaS Platform) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost per daily run (Ingest + Query)** | ~$0.15 (S3 + Athena pay-per-query) | ~$5.00 (Fixed daily rate of RDS instance) | N/A (Included in subscription fees) |
| **AI compute cost (Hosting/Month)** | ~$120 (EKS control plane + Spot node scaling) | ~$320 (Fargate always-on equivalent) | N/A |
| **Operational overhead (Hours/Week)** | ~4 hours (Managing EKS config, Helm updates) | ~2 hours (ECS managed task groups) | ~1 hour (SaaS connection updates) |
| **Account onboarding time** | < 10 mins (Terraform IAM cross-account stack) | ~25 mins (Manual DB schema setup + VPC peering) | > 60 mins (Manual setup + IAM configs) |
| **Scalability for model retraining** | Excellent (Spot node pools scaled via Karpenter) | Limited (Fargate max memory/CPU constraints) | Poor (AIOps model cannot run locally) |

### 3.3 Accepted weaknesses

- **EKS Control Plane Overhead**: Running EKS incurs a fixed control plane charge of $0.10/hour (~$73/month). This overhead is accepted because the same cluster hosts the stable API pods and scales the batch workers, which saves significant computing budget through Spot execution.
- **VPC Endpoints Cost**: Routing all traffic privately within the VPC requires interface endpoints (Secrets Manager, ECR, CloudWatch), adding fixed charges (~$7.20/endpoint/month). This is accepted to meet the strict security requirement of zero public transit of cost/audit data.
- **CUR Ingestion Latency**: AWS CUR exports lag by 8 to 24 hours. This lag is accepted since the platform runs on a 24-hour cadence, meaning real-time streaming is not required for daily anomaly detection.

---

## 4. Multi-account approach

### 4.1 Account model

The CDO platform is deployed in a central **CDO Management Account**. It ingests cost data from and triggers containment actions in multiple **Member Accounts** within the AWS Organization.
- **Cross-Account Cost Ingestion**: The central `LambdaCURPuller` assumes the read-only role `FinOpsCURPullerRole` in each target member account. This role grants access to retrieve local Cost Explorer API data and copy CUR files from the member account's S3 export bucket.
- **Cross-Account Containment**: The central `LambdaContainment` assumes `FinOpsContainmentWorkerRole` in the target member account. The assumed role contains tightly scoped permissions to tag resources or adjust Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in that specific member account.

The account model must preserve environment context because the same anomaly type has different action limits depending on environment. A runaway GPU workload in a non-prod research account may be eligible for containment after approval; a similar signal in a production payments account must remain tag/suggest/dry-run only.

### 4.2 Isolation pattern

- **Data Isolation**: Cost data collected from member accounts is stored in a single S3 bucket partitioned by Account ID: `s3://cdo-curated-bucket/account_id=123456789012/year=2026/month=06/`.
- **Query Isolation**: Athena table definitions use Glue partition projection. Athena queries executed for dashboard materialized views are restricted by the `account_id` partition key.
- **Ownership Resolution**: Resources are mapped to specific engineering squads using the standardized metadata tags `owner` and `squad`. When the ingestion pipeline encounters resources lacking these tags, it automatically assigns them to a default squad (`unassigned-resources`) and routes alerts to the CDO infrastructure channel for manual remediation.

Partitioning by account and period is the primary performance control, while tags provide the business ownership view. The platform must keep untagged spend visible instead of dropping it during normalization, because missing ownership tags are an important Finance escalation path even when AIOps owns the final anomaly classification.

### 4.3 Onboarding flow

When onboarding a new AWS account or squad to the FinOps Watch platform, the following automated pipeline is executed:

```
1. Add account ID and owner mapping to the Terraform 'accounts.tfvars' configuration.
2. Terraform execution applies IAM Stack:
   - Provisions 'FinOpsCrossAccountAccessRole' in the target member account.
   - Configures trust policy allowing the central CDO Lambda and EKS roles to assume it.
   - Updates target account CUR export configuration to deliver data to S3.
3. Glue crawler is triggered to update partitions in the Glue Data Catalog.
4. E2E Validation run:
   - Ingestion Lambda makes a test API call to target account Cost Explorer.
   - Verifies OIDC connection to EKS internal service endpoint.
5. Account status marked as 'ACTIVE' in the DynamoDB registry.
```

### 4.4 Idempotency

To prevent duplicate runs for the same cost period (which would skew dashboard data and incur duplicate Cost Explorer API fees), the CDO platform implements an idempotency mechanism:
- Every daily execution generates an idempotency key: `account_id:billing_period:execution_date` (e.g., `123456789012:2026-06:2026-06-22`).
- The Step Functions workflow begins by querying the DynamoDB `cdo-run-state-table` for the key.
- If the key exists with `Status = COMPLETED` or `Status = IN_PROGRESS`, the Step Functions workflow aborts gracefully, recording the duplicate attempt in the audit logs.
- If the key does not exist, a new record is created with `Status = IN_PROGRESS` and a TTL of 48 hours to lock the run.

---

## 5. Alternatives considered

### 5.1 Orchestration layer

- **Option A**: Apache Airflow on AWS (MWAA).
  - *Pros*: Excellent Python integration, native complex dependency trees, detailed task visualizer.
  - *Cons*: High fixed cost (~$350/month minimum), slow startup time (20+ minutes), complex infrastructure configuration.
- **Option B**: Kubernetes CronJobs inside EKS.
  - *Pros*: Runs inside the EKS cluster, no external AWS service dependencies.
  - *Cons*: Difficult to orchestrate external Lambda functions, no native cross-account workflow state machine, and harder to monitor execution state from outside the cluster.
- **Chosen**: EventBridge Scheduler + Step Functions Standard.
  - *Reason*: 100% serverless, zero idle costs, native integration with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, and robust out-of-the-box error retry handlers.

### 5.2 Data layer

- **Option A**: Amazon Redshift.
  - *Pros*: Ultra-fast relational SQL query performance on petabyte-scale datasets.
  - *Cons*: High minimum cost (~$180/month for a small provisioned node), excessive overhead for a mid-size company running 24h batch cycles.
- **Option B**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL.
  - *Pros*: Structured queries, familiar transaction support, easy index management.
  - *Cons*: Fixed monthly instance charge, manual storage scaling, and lacks direct, performant integration with raw S3 parquet files.
- **Chosen**: Amazon S3 + Glue Data Catalog + Amazon Athena.
  - *Reason*: Leverages the true lakehouse model. Storage costs are minimal (S3), query costs are pay-per-use (Athena), and it supports raw semi-structured JSON alongside optimized Parquet data cataloging.

---

## 6. Scaling strategy

The CDO platform scales dynamically to handle increases in data volume and compute requirements:

- **EKS Pod Autoscaling**: The `ai-engine-api` and `ai-engine-explainer` pods use Kubernetes **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)** to scale out (based on target CPU utilization of 70%) if concurrent request volume spikes.
- **EKS Node Autoscaling**: The EKS cluster utilizes **Karpenter** for node autoscaling. Karpenter dynamically provisions additional EC2 nodes when pending pods are detected. It schedules `ai-engine-worker` batch scoring jobs onto Spot nodes and stable API pods onto On-Demand nodes. It terminates idle nodes within 30 seconds of workload completion.
- **Athena Query Optimization**: S3 buckets are partitioned by `account_id`, `year`, and `month`. Athena queries limit data scans to specific partitions, preventing execution bottlenecks.
- **DynamoDB Scaling**: The `cdo-run-state-table` is configured in **On-Demand Capacity Mode**, allowing it to scale instantly from zero to thousands of read/write requests without manual intervention.

The production scaling assumption is that line-item volume grows faster than account count. Therefore, S3 partitioning, Athena scan limits, and AI batch worker autoscaling are more important than increasing Lambda concurrency. Model-training or backtest dataset size is handled by AIOps; CDO scales the operational ingestion, invocation, dashboard, and audit path.

## 7. Failure modes + recovery

The following table outlines the failure modes, detection mechanisms, and recovery runbooks for the CDO platform:

| Failure | Detection | Recovery | RTO | RPO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CUR Export Delay** | Step Functions validation Lambda returns empty or missing daily Parquet partition in S3. | Step Functions enters a wait state and retries every 2 hours. If delay exceeds 24 hours, it alerts the operator. | N/A | 24 hours |
| **Cost Explorer Throttling** | Ingestion Lambda catches `LimitExceededException` from AWS API. | Exponential backoff with random jitter in Lambda code; retries up to 5 times. | 30 mins | 0 |
| **AI Engine Timeout / Unavailability** | EKS internal ALB returns `504 Gateway Timeout` or `503 Service Unavailable`. | **CDO fails closed**: Ingestion workflow terminates, no automated containment actions are triggered, operators are alerted, and a run failure state is logged. | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| **Failed Run Workflow** | Step Functions execution status updates to `FAILED`; triggers CloudWatch Alarm. | Step Functions logs the error block to DynamoDB. Engineers resolve the issue and trigger a manual redrive of the state machine from the failed step. | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| **Duplicate Run Attempt** | DynamoDB write returns unique key constraint violation on the idempotency key. | The duplicate execution is terminated immediately without executing queries or calling the AI Engine API. | < 10s | 0 |
| **Dashboard Stale Data** | CloudWatch Alarm triggers if the latest curated partition timestamp is >26 hours old. | Alerts engineers to review the pipeline logs and manually trigger a redrive of the daily ingestion run. | 1 hour | 24 hours |
| **Alert Delivery Failure** | `LambdaAlertRouting` catches connection timeout or HTTP 5xx error from Slack API. | The Lambda function sends the alert payload to an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and attempts delivery via SES email fallback. | 10 mins | 0 |
