## 1. Architecture diagram

The CDO platform is designed around a lakehouse-centric data plane for ingest and analysis, orchestrated by serverless workflows, and integrated with a single shared AIOps-provided AI Engine hosted once per Task Force using AWS Lambda container images. The serverless compute tier utilizes Lambda functions running within private subnets. The central Step Functions orchestrator invokes the AI Engine Request Lambda directly. An asynchronous queueing model using SQS/DLQ isolates heavy inference workloads from request validation. The Request Lambda processes incoming detection requests, publishes them to SQS, and returns status immediately. Note that `/v1/detect` and `/v1/detect/result/{audit_id}` represent logical contract semantics for model integration, not deployed REST/HTTP routes in this baseline batch workflow, as no Private API Gateway is deployed.

The architecture is sized around recurring CDO platform responsibilities, not around the AIOps model-training dataset. CDO must reliably pull billing data from approved AWS sources, normalize it into a contract-ready shape, invoke the AIOps-owned AI Engine, and preserve the returned decision evidence. Any synthetic historical dataset used to train, enhance, or backtest the model remains AIOps-owned. Detection telemetry is strictly CUR-only (S3 CUR partition pulls and Cost Explorer API calls) and does NOT include CloudWatch utilization metrics (CPU, memory, database connections), which are used ONLY for platform operational observability (alerts, logging, metrics, dashboard).

*Caption: The CDO pipeline is triggered daily by EventBridge Scheduler. The Step Functions workflow coordinates ingestion from member accounts, writes raw CUR and Cost Explorer data to S3, and catalogs it. The workflow invokes the AIOps-owned AI Engine Request Lambda, which queues the detection task to SQS and returns an accepted status. The Worker Lambda is triggered by SQS, executes detection, and writes results and evidence directly to DynamoDB and S3. The Step Functions polling task checks status/results in DynamoDB directly. Dashboard views and containment workflows pull clean state from S3 and DynamoDB.*

To provide a clearer view of the CDO platform's operations, the overall architecture is broken down into a high-level overview followed by three detailed zoom-in diagrams below:

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture Overview

This diagram represents the high-level macro interactions between the central orchestrator, the lakehouse data plane, the Lambda container compute, and the alerting/containment engines.

```mermaid

    end

    Actions -->|9. Apply Policy| Members
    Actions -->|10. Publish| Dashboard[Finance Dashboard / Channels]
```

*Caption: The central Step Functions Orchestrator drives the entire FinOps loop: extracting data to the Lakehouse, calling the Lambda-container-hosted AI Engine Request Lambda, polling DynamoDB for anomaly decisions, and invoking alerting and containment workflows based on the results.*

Operationally, Step Functions is the control boundary between deterministic CDO logic and probabilistic AI output. Every transition records a `run_id`, cost window, account scope, and contract version so that Finance can trace a dashboard anomaly back to the exact ingestion batch and AI decision. This design also prevents the AI Engine from directly touching member accounts; all alerting and containment actions are mediated by CDO policy workers.

### 1.2 Ingestion & Data Lakehouse Workflow

This diagram zooms in on the ingestion pipeline and the lakehouse storage/query layers.

    end
    
    classDef external fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class CUR,CE external;
```

*Caption: Step Functions invokes the Ingestion Lambda daily via EventBridge Scheduler. Raw cost data from Member Accounts is stored in the S3 Raw Zone, transitioned and cataloged into Parquet format in the S3 Curated Zone, and made queryable via Athena. The query results are passed back to the Step Functions orchestrator to feed the AI Engine.*

The ingestion workflow normalizes the two operational billing shapes before invoking the AI Engine. CUR provides resource-level fields such as account ID, product code, resource ID, unblended cost, and resource tags. Cost Explorer provides aggregate fields such as linked account, service name, service code, region, unblended cost, and estimated/final status. The curated layer keeps both normalized service code and display-name fields so CDO can pass consistent payloads to AIOps and build dashboard views without taking ownership of model training data.

### 1.3 AI Engine Lambda Container Hosting Platform

This diagram zooms in on the AWS Lambda container architecture, showing the Step Functions invocation of the Request Lambda, SQS queuing, and the Worker Lambda executing asynchronous inference.

    Request -.->|Pull Image by Digest| ECR
    Worker -.->|Pull Image by Digest| ECR
    Request -.->|Access SDK| SM
    Worker -.->|Access SDK| SM
```

*Caption: The AI Engine detection request from the Step Functions orchestrator is sent via direct Lambda invocation to the AI Engine Request Lambda function. The Request Lambda validates the request, enqueues the job to an SQS Queue, and returns an accepted status with an audit ID. The Worker Lambda is triggered by SQS to perform batch scoring, read features from S3, and write results back to DynamoDB. API and execution secrets are retrieved using the AWS SDK from Secrets Manager.*

The Lambda-based platform separates request validation from asynchronous batch execution using SQS queues. The AI Engine Request Lambda function handles rapid ingress validation (accepting detection requests, generating audit IDs, and enqueuing jobs). The AI Engine Worker Lambda function is triggered asynchronously by SQS to perform resource-intensive model inference, checkpointing feature progress to S3 and storing final results in DynamoDB. The central Step Functions orchestrator polls the DynamoDB table directly to verify execution status and retrieve the final results. This decoupling ensures rapid response to the orchestrator, isolates compute consumption via reserved concurrency limits, and uses native SQS/DLQ retries to handle transient failures gracefully without REST/HTTP proxy layers.

### 1.4 Alerting & Containment Engine

This diagram zooms in on the alerting and containment flow, detailing how policy is enforced safely across production and non-production environments with a compliance audit trail.

    end

        CloudFront -->|Auth redirect| Cognito[Cognito User Pool]
        LambdaEdge["Lambda@Edge Auth Validator"] -->|Validate cookie JWT| CloudFront
    end
```

*Caption: The Step Functions workflow triggers separate alerting and containment Lambdas based on the AI Engine's decisions. Containment Lambdas read run state, write audit logs to DynamoDB, apply active containment (tag/shutdown) on Dev/Sandbox accounts, and execute dry-run actions (tag/suggest only) on Prod. An S3 + CloudFront static web dashboard reads precomputed DynamoDB/S3 JSON audit and spend summaries to present containment status directly to Finance stakeholders.*

The containment engine treats `execution_mode` as a mandatory policy input, not a runtime convenience. Production resources can only receive tag, suggest, or dry-run outcomes, while dev/sandbox resources may receive apply-mode actions only when policy and approval requirements are satisfied. Each proposed or executed action writes an audit record before attempting any member-account operation.

---

## 3. Differentiation angle deep-dive

### 3.1 Why this angle?

The CDO platform implements a **lakehouse-centric FinOps control plane with serverless orchestration and AWS Lambda container image hosting for the AI Engine**.
1. **Lakehouse Fit**: Production FinOps operates on a natural 24h cadence dictated by AWS CUR export frequencies. A lakehouse pattern (S3 + Glue + Athena) avoids the high fixed costs of an always-on data warehouse (like Redshift) or relational databases, while keeping historical cost data fully structured, audit-ready, and partition-queried.
2. **Serverless Orchestration**: EventBridge and Step Functions manage the flow serverless-first, keeping the operational overhead of the pipeline orchestrator near zero.
3. **AWS Lambda Container Hosting for AI**: The AIOps-provided AI Engine separates runtime tasks into:
   - Ingress validation tasks (handled by the Request Lambda) called directly by the orchestrator, performing rapid schema check and job enqueuing.
   - Asynchronous batch inference jobs (handled by the Worker Lambda) triggered via SQS to bypass Lambda timeout constraints.
   Hosting the AI Engine on AWS Lambda container images enables serverless scaling, eliminates idle compute costs (unlike always-on containers), and leverages ECR digest pinning for immutable deployment. Compute capacity and throttling are managed via Reserved Concurrency limits. Step Functions queries DynamoDB directly for completion status, removing the need for a synchronous HTTP polling endpoint. Offline model training, retraining, and heavy offline analysis remain outside the CDO runtime scope.

The practical reason this matters is operational independence. AIOps can iterate on model logic, feature engineering, and false-positive handling without changing the CDO workflow. CDO keeps the lakehouse, scheduler, API invocation path, alert routing, and containment policy stable, while the Lambda-container-hosted AI Engine can evolve behind a versioned contract.

### 3.2 Strengths (with metrics)

The metrics below highlight the trade-offs of the lakehouse-centric + Lambda container architecture compared to alternative CDO approaches:

| Axis | Chosen Angle (Lakehouse + Lambda Container) | Alternative A (ECS Cluster on EC2 + RDS Aurora) | Alternative B (Third-Party SaaS Platform) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost per daily run (Ingest + Query)** | ~$0.15 (S3 + Athena pay-per-query) | ~$5.00 (Fixed daily rate of RDS instance) | N/A (Included in subscription fees) |
| **AI compute cost (Hosting/Month)** | ~$40 (Lambda pay-per-use + SQS queueing) | ~$240 (ECS cluster management + Spot instance scaling) | N/A |
| **Operational overhead (Hours/Week)** | ~0.5 hours (Managing serverless Terraform Lambdas) | ~8 hours (ECS cluster on EC2 and Terraform ECS configuration updates) | ~1 hour (SaaS connection updates) |
| **Account onboarding time** | < 10 mins (Terraform IAM cross-account stack) | ~25 mins (Manual DB schema setup + VPC peering) | > 60 mins (Manual setup + IAM configs) |
| **Scalability for model retraining** | N/A (Offline; training stays offline / AIOps-managed) | Excellent (ECS Spot task pools scaled via AWS Application Auto Scaling) | Poor (AIOps model cannot run locally) |

### 3.3 Accepted weaknesses

- **Lambda Cold Start and Scale Concurrency Limits**: Running inference workloads on Lambda container images can introduce cold-start latency (pulling container images on initialization) and risk concurrency limit exhaustion. This is accepted because detection runs on a daily batch cadence (not real-time), and API concurrency is isolated via Reserved Concurrency constraints.
- **VPC Endpoints Cost**: Routing all traffic privately within the VPC requires interface endpoints (ECR, S3, DynamoDB, KMS, Logs, Secrets Manager), adding fixed charges (~$7.20/endpoint/month per AZ). This is accepted to meet the strict security requirement of zero public transit of cost/audit data.
- **CUR Ingestion Latency**: AWS CUR exports lag by 8 to 24 hours. This lag is accepted since the platform runs on a 24-hour cadence, meaning real-time streaming is not required for daily anomaly detection.

---

## 4. Multi-account approach

### 4.1 Account model

The CDO platform is deployed in a central **CDO Management Account**. It ingests cost data from and triggers containment actions in multiple **Member Accounts** within the AWS Organization.
- **Cross-Account Cost Ingestion**: The central `LambdaCURPuller` assumes the read-only role `FinOpsCURPullerRole` in each target member account. This role grants access to retrieve local Cost Explorer API data and copy CUR files from the member account's S3 export bucket.
- **Cross-Account Containment**: The central `LambdaContainment` assumes `FinOpsContainmentWorkerRole` in the target member account. The assumed role contains tightly scoped permissions to tag resources or adjust Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in that specific member account.

The account model must preserve environment context because the same anomaly type has different action limits depending on environment. A runaway GPU workload in a non-prod research account may be eligible for containment after approval; a similar signal in a production payments account must remain tag/suggest/dry-run only.

### 4.2 Isolation pattern

- **Data Isolation**: Cost data collected from member accounts is stored in a single S3 bucket partitioned by Account ID: `s3://cdo-curated-bucket/account_id=123456789012/year=2026/month=06/`.
- **Query Isolation**: Athena table definitions use Glue partition projection. Athena queries executed for dashboard materialized views are restricted by the `account_id` partition key.
- **Ownership Resolution**: Resources are mapped to specific engineering squads using the standardized metadata tags `owner` and `squad`. When the ingestion pipeline encounters resources lacking these tags, it automatically assigns them to a default squad (`unassigned-resources`) and routes alerts to the CDO infrastructure channel for manual remediation.

Partitioning by account and period is the primary performance control, while tags provide the business ownership view. The platform must keep untagged spend visible instead of dropping it during normalization, because missing ownership tags are an important Finance escalation path even when AIOps owns the final anomaly classification.

### 4.3 Onboarding flow

When onboarding a new AWS account or squad to the FinOps Watch platform, the following automated pipeline is executed:

```
1. Add account ID and owner mapping to the Terraform 'accounts.tfvars' configuration.
2. Terraform execution applies IAM Stack:
   - Provisions 'FinOpsCrossAccountAccessRole' in the target member account.
   - Configures trust policy allowing the central CDO Lambda and the AI Engine Lambda execution roles to assume it.
   - Updates target account CUR export configuration to deliver data to S3.
3. Glue crawler is triggered to update partitions in the Glue Data Catalog.
4. E2E Validation run:
   - Ingestion Lambda makes a test API call to target account Cost Explorer.
   - Verifies IAM cross-account permission assumption and direct Lambda invocation.
5. Account status marked as 'ACTIVE' in the DynamoDB registry.
```

### 4.4 Idempotency

To prevent duplicate runs for the same cost period (which would skew dashboard data and incur duplicate Cost Explorer API fees), the CDO platform implements an idempotency mechanism:
- Every daily execution generates an idempotency key: `account_id:billing_period:execution_date` (e.g., `123456789012:2026-06:2026-06-22`).
- The Step Functions workflow begins by querying the DynamoDB `cdo-run-state-table` for the key.
- If the key exists with `Status = COMPLETED` or `Status = IN_PROGRESS`, the Step Functions workflow aborts gracefully, recording the duplicate attempt in the audit logs.
- If the key does not exist, a new record is created with `Status = IN_PROGRESS` and a TTL of 48 hours to lock the run.

### 4.5 Cost Data Caching & Cost Explorer Rate Limit Control

To protect the AWS Cost Explorer API from exceeding its strict rate limit of **5 requests per second**, the CDO platform implements a DynamoDB-based caching strategy as described in the telemetry contract:
- **CDO Cache Storage**: The Ingestion Lambda queries daily Cost Explorer metrics and caches the result payload inside a dedicated DynamoDB table (`cdo-cost-cache-table`) keyed by `AccountID:DateRange`.
- **AI Engine Offline Consumption**: When the AIOps-provided AI Engine Worker executes and requires historical baseline cost data (such as 7-day or 30-day trailing spends for feature engineering and anomaly analysis), it reads the cached cost records directly from the CDO DynamoDB store (or S3 curated parquet files via Athena) using direct SDK calls under its execution role.
- **Benefits**: This prevents the AI Engine and multiple platform Lambdas from calling the Cost Explorer API concurrently, ensuring the platform remains well below the 5 requests/sec threshold and eliminating any chance of AWS throttling.

### 4.6 Telemetry Ingestion Compliance & Validation

The CDO platform enforces all data-plane validation and security controls defined in `telemetry-contract.md` and `ai-api-contract.md`:
- **Schema & Ingestion Types**: Telemetry complies with schema version 3 (`telemetry://finops-watch/v3`). Ingestion supports `RAW_JSON` (<10MB Cost Explorer API data) and `S3_POINTER` (<500MB compressed CUR exports stored in S3) data ingestion types. No CloudWatch performance telemetry (utilization signals like CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections, memory_mib) is sent to the AI Engine for detection; these are reserved strictly for platform operational observability (alerts, logging, metrics, dashboard).
- **Request & Integrity Fields**: Every direct Lambda invocation payload to the Request function includes standard cross-cutting metadata fields representing the contract headers: `tenant_id` (UUID v4), `idempotency_key` (composite key: `tenant_id:YYYY-MM-DD` with 24h DynamoDB TTL), `correlation_id` (UUID), `payload_sha256`, and `request_timestamp`.
- **Response Fields**: The API returns standard fields, including `audit_id`, `status` (`processing` | `completed` | `failed`), `anomalies_list` (containing `anomaly_metadata`, `finance_dashboard_data`, and `engineering_dashboard_data`), and `pagination` (with `next_token` and `limit`).
- **Control Flags**: 
  - `is_ad_hoc`: Bypasses 24h idempotency limits for emergency scans (capped at 5 requests/day).
  - `is_estimated`: Indicates AWS estimated data; lowers AI confidence score (<0.50), sets actions to review-only, and bypasses automatic containment.
  - `is_forced_dry_run`: Automatically set by the AI Engine if telemetry completeness score is `< 0.8`, forcing dry-run containment to prevent wrong actions on dirty data.
- **Audit Trail Chain**: Containment records write to a tamper-evident audit ledger using an integrity hash chain: `sha256(current_payload + previous_hash)` retained for $\ge 90$ days.
- **Request & Time Integrity**:
  - **Replay Protection**: The Request Lambda execution role and payload check enforces a 300-second request window (abs(now - timestamp) > 300s results in an error execution state with code `ERR_REPLAY_DETECTED`).
  - **Clock Skew Control**: Requests with a clock skew exceeding 10 seconds (`clock_skew_ms > 10000`) are rejected immediately.
- **Data Normalization & PII Scrubbing**: CDO anonymizes all PII at the ingestion layer, mapping CUR `line_item_unblended_cost` and reconciling CUR `service_code` (e.g., `AmazonEC2`) with Cost Explorer display names (`service`).
- **Business Context Signals**: Daily batches package external context markers (flash-sale, load test, or migration active flags) to provide the AI Engine with the business insights necessary to avoid benign false positive classifications.

## 5. Alternatives considered

### 5.1 Orchestration layer

- **Option A**: Apache Airflow on AWS (MWAA).
  - *Pros*: Excellent Python integration, native complex dependency trees, detailed task visualizer.
  - *Cons*: High fixed cost (~$350/month minimum), slow startup time (20+ minutes), complex infrastructure configuration.
- **Option B**: Lambda Direct Cron Trigger.
  - *Pros*: Simple, runs natively as an EventBridge schedule target calling a single Lambda function.
  - *Cons*: Difficult to orchestrate complex multi-step cross-account workflows, manage intermediate states, handle 15-minute timeout limitations, and implement custom error handlers compared to AWS Step Functions.
- **Chosen**: EventBridge Scheduler + Step Functions Standard.
  - *Reason*: 100% serverless, zero idle costs, native integration with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, and robust out-of-the-box error retry handlers.

### 5.2 Data layer

- **Option A**: Amazon Redshift.
  - *Pros*: Ultra-fast relational SQL query performance on petabyte-scale datasets.
  - *Cons*: High minimum cost (~$180/month for a small provisioned node), excessive overhead for a mid-size company running 24h batch cycles.
- **Option B**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL.
  - *Pros*: Structured queries, familiar transaction support, easy index management.
  - *Cons*: Fixed monthly instance charge, manual storage scaling, and lacks direct, performant integration with raw S3 parquet files.
- **Chosen**: Amazon S3 + Glue Data Catalog + Amazon Athena.
  - *Reason*: Leverages the true lakehouse model. Storage costs are minimal (S3), query costs are pay-per-use (Athena), and it supports raw semi-structured JSON alongside optimized Parquet data cataloging.

## 6. Scaling strategy

The CDO platform scales dynamically to handle increases in data volume and compute requirements:

- **Lambda Concurrency Limits**: The API and Worker Lambdas utilize AWS Lambda Reserved Concurrency limits to bound execution capacity. This prevents runaway API execution from consuming the entire account's concurrency pool, while Provisioned Concurrency can be enabled as a production optimization to eliminate cold-start lag.
- **SQS Ingestion Decoupling**: Rather than scaling computing tasks concurrently to handle massive ingestion batches, SQS queues buffer incoming tasks. This allows the Worker Lambda to process messages sequentially or in controlled batches (e.g. batch size of 10), preventing resource exhaustion on dependent databases like DynamoDB or external APIs.
- **Athena Query Optimization**: S3 buckets are partitioned by `account_id`, `year`, and `month`. Athena queries limit data scans to specific partitions, preventing execution bottlenecks.
- **DynamoDB Scaling**: The `cdo-run-state-table` is configured in **On-Demand Capacity Mode**, allowing it to scale instantly from zero to thousands of read/write requests without manual intervention.

The production scaling assumption is that line-item volume grows faster than account count. Therefore, S3 partitioning, Athena scan limits, and AI batch Lambda worker scaling are more important than increasing Lambda concurrency. Model-training or backtest dataset size is handled by AIOps; CDO scales the operational ingestion, invocation, dashboard, and audit path.

## 7. Failure modes + recovery

The following table outlines the failure modes, detection mechanisms, and recovery runbooks for the CDO platform:

| Failure | Detection | Recovery | RTO | RPO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CUR Export Delay** | Step Functions validation Lambda returns empty or missing daily Parquet partition in S3. | Step Functions enters a wait state and retries every 2 hours. If delay exceeds 24 hours, it alerts the operator. | N/A | 24 hours |
| **Cost Explorer Throttling** | Ingestion Lambda catches `LimitExceededException` from AWS API. | Exponential backoff with random jitter in Lambda code; retries up to 5 times. | 30 mins | 0 |
| **AI Engine Timeout / Function Error** | Orchestrator receives Lambda execution error, SDK timeout, or Bedrock timeout (Nova LLM hard limit). | **CDO fails closed**: Ingestion workflow terminates, containment actions are blocked, a failed run is logged, and CDO immediately falls back to static rule-based SRE alerting. | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| **Failed Run Workflow** | Step Functions execution status updates to `FAILED`; triggers CloudWatch Alarm. | Step Functions logs the error block to DynamoDB. Engineers resolve the issue and trigger a manual redrive of the state machine from the failed step. | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| **Duplicate Run Attempt** | DynamoDB write returns unique key constraint violation, or API returns HTTP `409` with `Retry-After: 30`. | CDO worker sleeps for 30 seconds and polls for results, avoiding double calls. | < 10s | 0 |
| **Mismatched Idempotency Payload** | API returns HTTP `400` with `ERR_IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH` due to different payload on same key. | CDO logs critical alert, blocks run, and SRE fixes the key generation logic. | 2 hours | 0 |
| **Dashboard Stale Data** | CloudWatch Alarm triggers if the latest curated partition timestamp is >26 hours old. | Alerts engineers to review the pipeline logs and manually trigger a redrive of the daily ingestion run. | 1 hour | 24 hours |
| **Alert Delivery Failure** | `LambdaAlertRouting` catches connection timeout or HTTP 5xx error from Slack API. | The Lambda function sends the alert payload to an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and attempts delivery via SES email fallback. | 10 mins | 0 |
| **Containment Action Denial** | Member account cross-account role assumption returns `AccessDeniedException`. | **CDO fails closed**: The incident is logged in the DynamoDB audit table as `DENIED`, and a critical alert is sent to the security channel. | 1 hour | 0 |
| **AI Contract Version Mismatch** | Pre-run validation finds that the deployed AI Engine API Lambda contract version differs from the Step Functions expected schema. | Block the run before detection, mark the run as `FAILED_CONTRACT_CHECK`, notify CDO and AIOps, and do not execute containment. | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| **SQS Worker Lambda Failure** | SQS message processing fails, or worker Lambda execution times out (15-min limit) or crashes. | The SQS queue automatically retries execution based on the redrive policy. If retries are exhausted, the message is routed to the SQS DLQ, and an operator alert is fired. | 1 hour | 0 for checkpointed work |
