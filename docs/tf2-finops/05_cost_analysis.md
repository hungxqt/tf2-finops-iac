## 1. Cost Model per Tenant and Cadence Run (Forecast)

A "tenant" in the TF2 FinOps Watch context is an AWS member account under cost monitoring. The cost model separates variable per-tenant costs from shared platform costs. This distinction matters because the lakehouse and Lambda workflow scale mostly with account/data volume, while Lambda containers and baseline observability create shared fixed cost that must be amortized across tenants.

CDO owns the operational hosting cost of the AIOps-provided AI Engine on Lambda container functions: Lambda container execution, ECR, Lambda execution roles, secrets plumbing, reserved concurrency, SQS/DLQ queues, and runtime monitoring. AIOps owns model development, model training design, model quality, and any synthetic historical dataset used to train, enhance, or backtest the model. If AIOps training or retraining tasks run on the CDO-hosted Lambda functions, the compute cost must be tagged and reported separately as "AI Engine workload cost hosted by CDO".

| Component | Unit Cost | Avg Usage Assumption | Cost treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compute - Lambda adapters** | $0.20/1M requests + $0.0000166667/GB-second | Puller, normalizer, router, containment, audit writer; 24h cadence | Variable per tenant; `Evidence needed: measured Lambda GB-seconds`. |
| **Orchestration - Step Functions Standard** | $0.025/1K state transitions | 1 workflow/day/account, retries included | Variable per tenant; low but must be measured with actual state count. |
| **Orchestration - EventBridge Scheduler** | $1.00/1M invocations | 1 scheduled trigger/day plus manual redrive | Shared negligible cost. |
| **Storage - S3 raw/curated** | $0.023/GB-month Standard, lower after lifecycle | CUR/Cost Explorer pulls, normalized parquet, and dashboard extracts | Variable by billing data volume. |
| **Storage - S3 authoritative audit** | $0.0125/GB-month IA estimate | Containment and decision evidence S3/Object Lock (retained at least 90 days), telemetry/history backup, and rollback evidence | Variable by alert/containment volume; retention is mandatory. |
| **Database - DynamoDB on-demand** | $1.25/million write + $0.25/million read | `finops-idempotency-{env}` (24h TTL), `finops-rollback-cache` (90-day TTL), and Dashboard Cache | Variable with runs and dashboard reads. |
| **Query - Athena** | $5.00/TB scanned | Dashboard refresh, evidence lookup, operational review | Variable; controlled by partition pruning and query limits. |
| **Data Catalog - Glue** | Catalog storage/metadata requests | Cost tables, partitions, Partition Projection (ADR-014) | Variable but negligible at capstone scale (free tier; ADR-014). |
| **Compute - AI Engine Lambda** | $0.20/1M requests + $0.0000166667/GB-second | AI Engine Lambda container function synchronous execution; 24h cadence | Variable AI workload hosting cost; tag separately from CDO adapters. |
| **Hàng đợi SQS & DLQ** | $0.40/million requests | Buffering retry requests for alert routing Lambda | Variable queue operations cost. |
| **ECR repositories** | $0.10/GB-month storage | Versioned AIOps container images and Lambda container image versions | Shared fixed/variable by retained image count. |
| **Compute - Private ALB / HTTPS Adapter** | $0.0225/hour + $0.008/LCU-hour | SigV4 internal ALB endpoint for routing to Lambda (~$16.20/month fixed) | Shared fixed routing cost for secure /v1/* endpoints. |
| **VPC endpoints** | Hourly endpoint charge + data processing where applicable | Private connections for ECR, S3, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, Logs, KMS, and STS | Shared fixed security cost. |
| **Secrets Manager** | $0.40/secret/month + request charges | Dashboard database credentials, webhooks, external IDs | Shared fixed plus request volume. |
| **KMS** | $1.00/CMK/month + request charges | Data, audit, secrets, encryption keys | Shared fixed; consolidation requires Security approval. |
| **Observability - CloudWatch, Prometheus, OTel & X-Ray** | Logs, metrics, trace analyzer, ADOT/OTel collector, and dashboard charges | Lambda logs, Step Functions traces, queue metrics, performance metrics (CPU, Memory, database utilization), and platform dashboards | Shared and variable; ADOT and telemetry collection can become a top cost driver. |
| **Query - Cost Explorer API** | $0.01 per request | Fallback cost query ONLY when S3 CUR is delayed (`telemetry_delay_event = true`) | Conditional fallback cost; otherwise $0 under normal CUR operations. |
| **Provisioned Concurrency (Optional)** | $0.015/GB-second + $0.15/1M requests concurrency charges | Pre-warmed execution environments for the AI Engine Lambda container function | Optional production optimization; `Evidence needed: required concurrency and warm-up hours`. |
| **Dashboard - S3 + CloudFront** | S3 & CloudFront pricing | Finance stakeholder dashboard access | S3 storage and CloudFront HTTPS request/data transfer fees. |
| **Amazon Cognito (Auth)** | Free tier up to 50,000 MAUs; then $0.0055/MAU | User directory and Hosted UI auth gateway for dashboard access | Shared platform cost; free for capstone scale. |
| **Lambda@Edge Viewer-Request Auth** | $0.60 per 1 million requests + duration ($0.0000500125/GB-sec) | Edge validation of JWT signatures against Cognito JWKS | Variable dashboard request cost; very low for target user base. |
| **Alerting - SNS/SES/Slack integration** | Request/message charges | Finance and Engineering alert routes | Variable but expected low. |
| **Total CDO platform forecast** | Mixed fixed and variable | CDO infra plus CDO-hosted AI Engine runtime | `Evidence needed: recalculated after Lambda memory size, endpoint count, and run volume are finalized`. |

**Important notes**:
- The above forecast is the estimated **CDO platform infrastructure** including the CDO-owned Lambda container hosting platform, but excluding AIOps-owned model development and model-quality work.
- VPC endpoints, KMS, and observability are the largest fixed costs.
- Actual costs must be measured from tagged AWS spend. Use `Evidence needed: CDO Lambda hosting actual`, `Evidence needed: CDO pipeline per-run actual`, and `Evidence needed: AI workload hosted-on-CDO actual` until measured.
- Enabling the `callback_url` parameter triggers additional egress data transfer, logging, and retry costs when asynchronous notifications are enabled.

## 2. Cost at Scale

As tenant count grows, fixed costs such as VPC endpoints, KMS CMKs, and S3 + CloudFront dashboard are amortized across multiple tenants, reducing average per-tenant cost. This section uses a forecast structure rather than claiming measured results.

| Tenant Count | Shared fixed platform/month | Variable CDO workflow/month | Hosted AI workload/month | Total/month | Avg/tenant |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | `Evidence needed: VPC endpoints` | `Evidence needed: one account run cost` | `Evidence needed: AI Lambda usage` | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` |
| **10** | Same shared baseline | `Evidence needed: 10-account run cost` | `Evidence needed: AI Lambda usage` | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` |
| **50** | Same shared baseline plus possible scaling | `Evidence needed: 50-account run cost` | `Evidence needed: AI Lambda usage` | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` |
| **200** | Shared baseline plus scale-out assumptions | `Evidence needed: 200-account run cost` | `Evidence needed: AI Lambda usage` | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` |

**Fixed costs include**:
- 6× VPC Interface Endpoints (ECR, Logs, KMS, Secrets Manager, STS): $43.20 (with S3 and DynamoDB configured as free Gateway Endpoints)
- 1× Private Internal ALB / HTTPS Adapter: $16.20
- 3× KMS CMKs: $3.00
- Dashboard - S3 + CloudFront (MVP): S3 storage & CloudFront request/data transfer fees (typically <$1.00/month)
- CloudWatch dashboard, logs, metrics, and X-Ray tracing: `Evidence needed: retained log volume`

**Analysis**:
- VPC endpoints constitute the platform baseline supporting secure Lambda hosting, queue buffering, observability, and private networking.
- At larger tenant counts, average cost should decline because the baseline endpoints and dashboard costs are shared.
- The break-even point must be recalculated after Lambda container invocation volumes and AI worker queue patterns are known; do not reuse the older serverless-only $46.77/tenant estimate.

## 3. Applied Cost Optimizations

| Optimization | Status | Estimated Savings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lambda right-sizing** |  Implemented | 15-20% compute cost | Benchmarked to choose 512MB instead of 1024MB for workers |
| **S3 Lifecycle tiering** |  Implemented | 40% storage cost | Raw zone: Standard 7 days -> IA 30 days -> Glacier 90 days; Audit: IA after 30 days |
| **DynamoDB on-demand** |  Implemented | 20% vs provisioned | Batch workload is uneven, on-demand fits better than provisioned capacity |
| **Athena partition pruning** |  Implemented | 60-80% query cost | Partition by cost_period_start, account_id, service |
| **VPC Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB)** |  Implemented | $0.09/GB NAT cost | S3/DDB traffic bypasses NAT Gateway |
| **CloudWatch Logs retention** |  Implemented | 50% logs cost | Application logs: 14 days; Audit logs: 90 days then export to S3 |
| **Lambda reserved concurrency** |  Implemented | N/A | Baseline Reserved Concurrency (5-10 concurrent executions) acts as a cost/blast guardrail, while Provisioned Concurrency is optional. |
| **Savings Plans / Reserved Instances** |  W12 T4 evaluation | 20-40% compute | Need 2-week baseline to determine commitment; not applied in 2-week capstone |
| **SQS batching for alerts** | Implemented | 20-40% Lambda cost | Batch SQS messages (e.g., 5 or 10 messages) to invoke fewer alert routing Lambda executions. |
| **Lambda right-sizing & architecture choice** | Implemented | 15-30% compute cost | Select x86_64 or Graviton2 based on performance/cost ratio, right-sizing memory limits. |
| **Provisioned Concurrency scaling rules** | Evidence needed | 20-40% concurrency cost | Use scaling policies to disable Provisioned Concurrency outside of daily execution windows. |
| **Cross-region replication** |  Out of scope | N/A | Single-region `ap-southeast-1`; DR design-only |
| **Bedrock prompt caching** |  Out of scope | N/A | AI inference cost belongs to AIOps |

**Summary**: Applied optimizations reduce cost compared to an unoptimized baseline, but the exact percentage is `Evidence needed: measured optimized vs unoptimized forecast`. The previous serverless-only estimate is no longer valid because CDO now owns Lambda container hosting infrastructure for the AIOps AI Engine runtime.

## 4. Cost Comparison with Other Angles (Same Task Force)

This section compares the current CDO06 direction against common alternatives. It does not claim final measured numbers for other teams; those remain evidence gaps until their documents are available.

| Architecture Angle | $/tenant/month (forecast) | Difference Reason | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CDO06: Lakehouse-centric scheduled + Lambda container-hosted AI Engine** | `Evidence needed: CDO platform actual after Lambda memory/concurrency sizing` | Serverless orchestration keeps CDO adapters low-cost, while Lambda container functions add compute hosting cost for AIOps runtime. | Win axis: traceable FinOps control plane, private AI Engine hosting, safe containment, and amortized platform cost at scale. |
| Pure serverless CDO prototype (without container support) | Lower one-tenant fixed cost, but incomplete for current scenario | Avoids ECR container storage. | Rejected because current scenario requires CDO-hosted AI Engine runtime to accept containerized model artifacts from AIOps. |
| Always-on warehouse approach | Higher fixed data cost | Redshift/RDS-style storage can simplify some SQL workflows but creates idle cost for 24h cadence. | Rejected because S3/Glue/Athena fits daily FinOps evidence with lower idle cost. |
| Third-party FinOps SaaS | Subscription-dependent | Can reduce platform operations but weakens CDO/AIOps ownership boundary and containment guardrail control. | Not selected for capstone implementation. |

**Evidence needed for fair comparison**:
- Compute pattern cost (Lambda container execution duration vs ECS Fargate vs EC2)
- Storage/query cost (RDS vs Redshift vs Athena vs EMR)
- Networking cost (VPC endpoints vs NAT Gateway vs private VPC routing)
- Operational cost (managed Lambda service overhead vs container orchestrator cluster)
- AI Engine hosting split (CDO platform runtime vs AIOps model development/training)

## 5. Measured Actual (Pack #2 W12 T4)

### 5.1 2-Week Capstone Spend

This section must be filled only after running the platform with tagged AWS resources. CDO demo injections may be used for smoke tests, but AIOps-owned model training/backtest datasets must not be counted as CDO operational spend unless they run on the CDO-hosted Lambda functions.

| Service | Forecast (14 days) | Actual (14 days) | Delta | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lambda adapters | `Evidence needed: forecast from memory/runtime` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Puller, normalizer, router, containment, audit writer. |
| Step Functions | `Evidence needed: state transition count` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Include retries and manual redrives. |
| S3 raw/curated/audit | `Evidence needed: GB-month and request forecast` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Separate cost data and audit evidence prefixes. |
| DynamoDB | `Evidence needed: read/write forecast` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Read cache for dashboard and metadata. |
| Athena/Glue | `Evidence needed: scanned TB and catalog queries` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Validate partition pruning and Partition Projection (ADR-014). |
| AI Engine Lambda compute | `Evidence needed: invocation count and GB-seconds` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | AI Engine Lambda container execution duration. |
| SQS queues & DLQ | `Evidence needed: message count` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Buffering operations for alert routing retry execution. |
| ECR image storage | `Evidence needed: image count and sizes` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | ECR repository for Lambda container images. |
| VPC Endpoints | `Evidence needed: 7 endpoints × hourly charge` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Private AWS service access. |
| CloudWatch/X-Ray | `Evidence needed: log volume and metric count` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Lambda, Step Functions, SQS. |
| KMS/Secrets Manager | `Evidence needed: CMK and secret count` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Data, audit, AI Engine secret, webhooks. |
| Amazon Cognito | Free tier up to 50,000 MAUs | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | User pool and login authentication for the dashboard. |
| Lambda@Edge Viewer-Request Auth | `Evidence needed: request count and execution duration` | `Evidence needed: Cost Explorer tag report` | `Evidence needed` | Edge authorization filtering for S3/CloudFront. |
| **Total** | `Evidence needed: forecast total` | `Evidence needed: actual total` | `Evidence needed` | Do not publish a final number until measured. |

**Measurement methodology**:
1. Enable Cost Explorer with tags `Project=TF2-FinOps-CDO06` and `Environment=Sandbox`.
2. Run CDO integration workflow 1x/day for 14 days with approved demo inputs and dry-run containment.
3. Export AWS Cost and Usage Report after 14 days, filter by tags.
4. Split costs into CDO adapters, CDO Lambda container hosting baseline, hosted AI workload runtime, storage/query, networking, and observability.
5. Compare forecast vs actual, analyze outliers, and mark every unmeasured value with `Evidence needed: ...`.

### 5.2 Per-Tenant Actual

After onboarding test accounts with different load levels:

| Test Account Profile | Characteristics | Cost/day (actual) | Extrapolate $/month | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small | Low account count, low CUR volume, few dashboard readers | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` | Validates minimum viable workflow cost. |
| Medium | Moderate account count, common shared services, multiple owner tags | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` | Validates expected capstone operating shape. |
| Large | Higher account count, larger CUR volume, heavier dashboard/query activity | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` | Validates Athena scan limits and SQS worker queue backlog scaling. |

**Expected insight**: S3, Athena, DynamoDB, and Lambda costs scale with account and data volume. Baseline VPC endpoints scale as shared fixed platform cost, while Lambda container invocations scale with the AI request and worker queue capacity.

### 5.3 Cost-per-Correct-Decision

This metric measures the cost efficiency of the full FinOps Watch decision loop. CDO can report CDO platform cost and CDO-hosted AI runtime cost, but AIOps must provide model-quality metrics and any model-development cost they want included.

| Metric | Value (forecast) | Value (actual W12) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Total AI Engine calls** | `Evidence needed: planned run count × account count` | `Evidence needed` | Count only operational contract calls from CDO to the hosted AI Engine. |
| **Correct decisions** | AIOps-provided metric | `Evidence needed: AIOps evaluation result` | CDO does not derive this from the AI team's training dataset. |
| **CDO platform cost** | `Evidence needed: CDO forecast total` | `Evidence needed` | CDO adapters, lakehouse, dashboard, alerting, audit, VPC endpoint baseline. |
| **Hosted AI runtime cost on CDO Lambda** | `Evidence needed: worker/API task cost allocation` | `Evidence needed` | Runtime cost only, separated from AIOps model development. |
| **AIOps model development cost** | Out of CDO scope unless AIOps provides it | AIOps-provided | Optional for full task-force ROI, not a CDO claim. |
| **Cost per correct decision** | `Evidence needed` | `Evidence needed` | = agreed total cost / AIOps-provided correct decisions. |

**Benchmark comparison**:
- Manual anomaly detection cost: ~$200/anomaly (8 hours × $25/hour Finance analyst)
- Target: Cost-per-correct-decision should remain materially below manual review cost after AIOps provides correct-decision counts and CDO provides measured hosting/operations cost.

## 6. Cost Guardrails

To prevent cost overruns during capstone and demo:

| Guardrail | Threshold | Action | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly budget alert 70%** | `Evidence needed: capstone Lambda-aware budget × 70%` | CloudWatch alarm -> SNS Engineering | CDO team reviews usage patterns |
| **Monthly budget alert 90%** | `Evidence needed: capstone Lambda-aware budget × 90%` | Alarm + email escalation to mentor | CDO + Mentor review |
| **Monthly budget hard stop 100%** | `Evidence needed: approved capstone budget` | Disable scheduler and block non-essential worker jobs | Auto fail-safe to prevent runaway cost |
| **Bedrock token budget** | <$50/month ($1.67/day limit) | Fallback levels: Level 1 (80% daily budget) Nova Pro -> Nova Lite; Level 2 (100% daily budget) Nova -> Rules Engine; Level 3 (120% monthly budget) halts processing. | CDO + AIOps joint governance |
| **Per-tenant S3 quota** | 100 GB/tenant curated data | S3 bucket quota + alarm | Prevent single tenant data explosion |
| **Athena query daily limit** | 200 GB scanned/day | Service Quotas + alarm | Cap ad-hoc query cost |
| **Lambda concurrent execution** | 10 concurrent | Reserved concurrency limit | Prevent lambda storm |
| **DynamoDB WCU/RCU burst** | Auto-scaling max 100 | DynamoDB auto-scaling cap | Limit burst cost |
| **VPC endpoint hourly cost** | $50.40/month fixed | Alert on unexpected endpoint creation | Prevent fixed networking cost drift |
| **Lambda execution duration** | `Evidence needed: max execution hours/day` | Stop runaway SQS worker executions and alert CDO/AIOps | Prevent runaway batch processing cost |

**Monitoring dashboard**: CloudWatch dashboard `FinOpsWatch-CDO-CostGuardrails` shows:
- Daily spend trend (last 7 days)
- Forecast vs actual spend
- Top 5 cost drivers (service breakdown, including Lambda compute, SQS, VPC endpoints, CloudWatch, Athena)
- Budget utilization %
- Hosted AI runtime cost separated from AIOps model-development cost

*Note on performance metrics: Performance metrics (CPU, Memory, database connections, SQS backlogs) are gathered by CloudWatch Metrics, Prometheus, OTel, and X-Ray, and are sent to the AI Engine as part of the hybrid detection telemetry schema. If these metrics are missing, the system falls back to CUR-only mode, halving model confidence and running in dry-run/alert-only mode.*

## 7. Production Cost Recommendations

After completing the 2-week capstone with actual baseline, the following recommendations should be considered for long-term production deployment:

| Recommendation | When to Apply | Estimated Savings | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compute Savings Plans** | After 3-month baseline | 20-30% on stable execution baseline | Applicable to Lambda executions (including the AI Engine Lambda container function and other CDO adapter Lambdas). |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | Immediately | 10-15% storage cost | Replace manual lifecycle rules |
| **DynamoDB Reserved Capacity** | After 6-month baseline | 40-60% DDB cost | When provisioned is cheaper than on-demand |
| **VPC Endpoint consolidation** | When multi-workload exists | 50% endpoint cost | Share endpoints across platforms |
| **CloudWatch Logs export to S3** | Immediately | 70% log storage cost | Logs >14 days export to S3 IA |
| **Cross-region replication** | Only when DR required | Avoid 2× storage cost | Don't enable if not necessary |
| **QuickSight Enterprise** | Future BI integration option | Advanced reporting & ad-hoc analytics | Retained as a future BI option for larger Finance teams, avoiding per-reader seat fees for the MVP dashboard. |
| **Athena query result caching** | Immediately | 30-50% repeat query cost | Dashboard refresh uses 24h cache |
| **KMS key consolidation** | When compliance signed-off | 33% KMS cost | Use 1 CMK for data + audit instead of 3 keys |
| **Lambda architecture optimization** | Immediately | 10-20% compute savings | Transition Lambda execution to Graviton2 (arm64) CPU architecture. |
| **Image retention policy** | Immediately | 10-30% ECR storage | Keep required release history but expire unreferenced build images. |

**Estimated total savings when applying all recommendations**: `Evidence needed: long-term measured baseline`. The largest likely savings areas are Lambda execution right-sizing, SQS batching optimization, log retention, Athena partition pruning, and endpoint sharing.

## 8. Cost Risk Analysis

| Cost Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Athena query storm** (unoptimized ad-hoc queries) | +$50-200/day | Medium | Query result caching, mandatory partition pruning, query cost alarm |
| **S3 storage explosion** (no lifecycle) | +$10-50/month | Low | Automatic lifecycle rules, bucket quota, storage growth alarm |
| **Lambda timeout loop** (retry storm) | +$20-100/day | Low | Circuit breaker, exponential backoff, max retry limit |
| **VPC endpoint always-on cost** | $28.80/month fixed | Certain | Cannot reduce; accept security vs cost trade-off |
| **AI Engine outage -> CDO retry storm** | +$10-50/day | Medium | Circuit breaker with backoff, max 3 retries, fail-closed workflow |
| **CloudWatch Logs unlimited retention** | +$5-20/month | Low | Auto-expire 14 days, critical logs export S3 |
| **Lambda cold-start provisioned concurrency** | +$50-150/month | Medium | Apply Provisioned Concurrency only where latency SLAs are breached; use autoscaling. |
| **SQS retry loops** | +$50-300/day | Medium | Set maximum SQS receive counts, configure DLQs, check execution status. |
| **CloudWatch high-cardinality metrics** | +$20-100/month | Medium | Limit custom metrics labels, use default VPC endpoint metrics. |
| **Retry and cache-storage costs** | Variable | Medium | Dynamically bounded by log retention (14 days app / 90 days audit) and cache lifecycle rules (24h S3 / 30 days DynamoDB). |
| **Mơ hồ sở hữu chi phí AIOps/CDO** | Budget disputes | Medium | Tag AI runtime separately from AIOps model development/training. |
