# Requirements Analysis - Task Force 2 · FinOps Watch CDO

<!-- Doc owner: CDO Team
     Status: Final (W11 T6 Pack #1) → Refined (W12 T4 Pack #2)
-->

## 1. Context

Task Force 2 is building the **FinOps Watch** platform for the CFO of a mid-size company operating a multi-account AWS environment (~80 engineers across 12 squads). Last month, the company experienced a 2.3× spike in its AWS bill, which surged from a baseline of ~$180k to ~$420k. The root cause was a forgotten training cluster running in a non-production account, consuming ~$400/day for 18 days (~$7k wasted). It took the Finance team nearly a week to trace and identify this waste.

The CFO wants a continuous **FinOps Watch** system running on a defined cadence that pulls cost data (CUR and Cost Explorer API), detects anomalies with measurable precision and false-positive rates, routes alerts to the correct teams (Finance vs. Engineering), and triggers safe, automated containment actions for obvious waste patterns (e.g., idle resources, mis-tagged spend, runaway training clusters).

The CDO team is responsible for the FinOps control plane, building a lakehouse-centric architecture to ingest and process cost data, orchestration workflow, operational state management, dashboard views, alert routing, containment guardrails, and audit logs. The CDO team also hosts the AI Engine provided by the AIOps team on AWS EKS, dividing workloads between on-demand and spot node groups.

The AIOps team owns any synthetic historical dataset used to train, enhance, calibrate, or backtest the anomaly model. The CDO documentation treats that dataset as upstream model-quality input, not as a CDO platform sizing source or operational data source. CDO consumes the model through a signed API contract, persists the returned decision evidence, and proves that alerting and containment policy are applied safely.

For Finance stakeholders, success means the dashboard can answer four questions without SQL: what changed, which account or squad owns it, how confident the platform is, and what action is allowed. For CDO reviewers, success means every scheduled run has a traceable input window, idempotency key, AI Engine contract version, alert decision, containment mode, and audit record.

## 2. Infra non-functional requirements

The CDO platform must meet the following non-functional requirements (NFRs) to ensure operational readiness:

| NFR | Target | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduled processing cadence | 24h default | Defends trade-off between CUR/Cost Explorer data availability, operational cost, and false-positive control. |
| Availability | ≥99.5% for scheduled run workflows and dashboards | Ensures consistent execution of the cost inspection pipeline. |
| Auditability | ≥90 days retention, append-only logs for containment | Mandatory client requirement for compliance and traceback. |
| Dashboard readability | Finance-friendly UI, zero SQL knowledge required | CFO's team must understand cost anomalies without technical queries. |
| Cost per run | Minimize; tracked with `Evidence needed: CDO pipeline run costs` | Ensures the platform itself is cost-effective. |
| Security baseline | IAM least-privilege, multi-account read-only access | Core boundary: NEVER terminate prod, delete data, or modify IAM. |
| AI Engine hosting uptime | ≥99.5% availability for the hosted model API | CDO hosted AI Engine API on EKS must be reliable for synchronous inference. |
| Cost data contract coverage | Account, service, region, resource, tag, cost period, USD amount, and estimated/final flag | Ensures CDO sends enough operational context to the AIOps AI Engine without owning model training data. |
| Idempotency | One accepted run per account and cost window | Prevents duplicate alerts, duplicate AI Engine calls, and double-counted dashboard materializations. |
| Alert explainability | Every anomaly alert includes confidence, severity, evidence window, owner route, and explanation | Finance and Engineering must be able to decide whether the alert is valid and what to do next. |
| Containment safety | Prod limited to tag, suggest, or dry-run; non-prod actions require policy approval | Keeps automation useful without crossing the client hard boundary. |

The NFRs are intentionally written as operational targets, not only architecture preferences. The CDO platform can pass the capstone only if it can prove that the daily workflow ran, that the AI Engine was invoked through the agreed contract, that model outputs were validated before use, and that every recommended action is auditable for at least 90 days.

## 3. Differentiation angle (KEY)

- **Angle chosen**: Lakehouse-centric FinOps control plane with serverless orchestration and CDO-hosted AI Engine on AWS EKS.
- **Why this angle**: Production FinOps follows a natural 24h cadence based on CUR data export intervals. Ingesting CUR and Cost Explorer API data into a lakehouse (S3 + Glue + Athena) allows for structured historical query access, auditability, and finance-friendly materialized views. The AI Engine is deployed on a dedicated EKS cluster, utilizing managed node groups to optimize costs: stable APIs (inference/explainer) run on on-demand nodes, while heavy batch workloads (batch scoring, feature engineering, model retraining) run on spot nodes. This hybrid design minimizes idle compute costs and guarantees platform scalability.
- **Trade-off accepted**: Operational complexity of running EKS and Helm/GitOps deployment pipelines, compared to a pure serverless container setup. This is accepted because EKS provides granular control over workload placement (on-demand vs. spot node affinity), network isolation (network policies), and scales efficiently for large batch/training jobs.
- **Lock date**: 2026-06-23 (enforcing W11 design lock).

The differentiation is not "use AI for FinOps"; that ownership belongs to AIOps. The CDO differentiation is the control plane around the AI decision: repeatable data pulls, queryable historical evidence, versioned model invocation, safe routing, policy-enforced containment, and finance-readable reporting. A purely dashboard-centric approach would show spend but not close the loop. A purely automation-centric approach would act too aggressively without enough evidence. The chosen angle keeps the daily FinOps loop measurable and reversible.

The integration contract reinforces this angle. CDO normalizes AWS billing inputs before invoking the AI Engine, keeps the model invocation versioned, and records enough evidence for Finance and Engineering to understand the decision path. AIOps can improve the model independently, while CDO keeps the operational loop stable.

## 4. CDO vs AIOps responsibility split

The responsibility boundary between the CDO and AIOps teams is defined as follows:

| Responsibility | CDO | AIOps |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest cost data (CUR, Cost Explorer API) | Owns | |
| Normalize cost windows & schema validation | Owns | |
| Tag metadata & resource ownership resolution | Owns | |
| Orchestration workflow (Step Functions) | Owns | |
| Run state, idempotency & scheduling | Owns | |
| Finance-friendly dashboard views (QuickSight/Athena) | Owns | |
| Alert routing (Finance vs. Engineering channels) | Owns | |
| Safe containment guardrails & audit log trail | Owns | |
| EKS Cluster Hosting Platform (Cluster lifecycle, IAM roles, VPC networking) | Owns | |
| EKS Managed Node Groups (On-demand/Spot configurations) | Owns | |
| Deployment pipelines (Helm, GitOps, IaC) for AI workloads | Owns | |
| Runtime monitoring & autoscaling (HPA/KEDA) | Owns | |
| AI Engine model internals, logic & code | | Owns |
| Model training, retraining & hyperparameter selection | | Owns |
| Confidence scoring & anomaly classification logic | | Owns |
| Explanatory text & natural language summaries | | Owns |
| Model versioning & artifact publishing | | Owns |
| AI model backtest performance and metrics | | Owns |
| Versioned container artifacts (images, weights, configs) | | Provides |

*Note: The CDO team consumes the AI Engine through a versioned API contract exposed via the internal service endpoint on EKS. AIOps delivers versioned container images and model weights, while CDO manages the operational execution, scaling, and fault tolerance.*

The boundary is enforced at runtime as well as in documentation. CDO validates the `/detect` request and response schema before each compatible release, records the model version returned by AIOps, persists the evidence URI for every anomaly, and fails closed when the AI Engine is unavailable or returns an invalid payload. AIOps remains accountable for model quality metrics such as precision, recall, confidence calibration, and explanation logic, while CDO remains accountable for whether those outputs are used safely in alerting, dashboarding, and containment workflows.

The minimum AI decision output consumed by CDO is: `run_id`, `model_version`, `anomaly_id`, `tenant/account`, `anomaly_type`, `confidence`, `severity`, `expected_spend`, `actual_spend`, `delta`, `evidence_window`, `explanation`, `recommended_route`, `recommended_containment_mode`, and `evidence_uri`. Missing required fields block containment and create an operator alert.

## 5. Constraints

- **AWS only**: No multi-cloud architectures. All services must deploy in `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Synthetic model data is AIOps-owned**: Historical synthetic datasets used for model training, enhancement, or backtesting are owned by AIOps. CDO may reference AIOps-provided metrics, but must not claim ownership of the model dataset.
- **Backtest target**: The AI Engine must achieve a precision of ≥80% and a false-positive rate of ≤10% over a 3-month historical test period. CDO stores these metrics as integration evidence.
- **Cadence**: 24h scheduled batch processing.
- **NEVER terminate prod, NEVER delete data, NEVER modify IAM**: Absolute hard safety boundaries. Any auto-containment action on production resources is strictly prohibited. Production actions are limited to: tag, suggest, or dry-run.
- **Dry-run mode**: Mandatory for all containment patterns across all environments.
- **Audit trail**: Required for every containment proposal or execution, with a minimum retention period of 90 days.
- **Dashboard accessibility**: Visual dashboard tailored for Finance stakeholders without requiring SQL knowledge.
- **Code freeze**: Wednesday W12.
- **CDO demo data**: CDO may use synthetic anomaly injections for integration smoke tests, dashboard demonstrations, and containment dry-runs only. These demo events are not AI training evidence.
- **Region**: Primary implementation target is `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Containment scope**: At least one non-prod containment path may be implemented, but prod containment remains tag/suggest/dry-run only regardless of anomaly confidence.
- **Measurement honesty**: Unmeasured run cost, dashboard latency, alert delivery latency, AI inference latency, and actual precision results must remain marked as `Evidence needed: ...` until the team captures evidence.

These constraints define what the CDO platform must not do. The system is allowed to detect, explain, route, tag, suggest, and simulate containment. It is not allowed to become an unrestricted cleanup bot, a billing-data exfiltration path, or an IAM automation tool.
