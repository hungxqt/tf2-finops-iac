# Requirements Analysis - Task Force 2 · FinOps Watch CDO

<!-- Doc owner: CDO Team
     Status: Final (W11 T6 Pack #1) -> Refined (W12 T4 Pack #2)
-->

## 1. Context

Task Force 2 is building the **FinOps Watch** platform for the CFO of a mid-size company operating a multi-account AWS environment (~80 engineers across 12 squads). Last month, the company experienced a 2.3× spike in its AWS bill, which surged from a baseline of ~$180k to ~$420k. The root cause was a forgotten training cluster running in a non-production account, consuming ~$400/day for 18 days (~$7k wasted). It took the Finance team nearly a week to trace and identify this waste.

The CFO wants a continuous **FinOps Watch** system running on a defined cadence that pulls cost data (CUR and Cost Explorer API), detects anomalies with measurable precision and false-positive rates, routes alerts to the correct teams (Finance vs. Engineering), and triggers safe, automated containment actions for obvious waste patterns (e.g., idle resources, mis-tagged spend, runaway training clusters).

The CDO team is responsible for the FinOps control plane, building a lakehouse-centric architecture to ingest and process cost data (S3 CUR partition pulls and Cost Explorer API calls) along with CloudWatch resource utilization metrics, orchestration workflows, operational state management, dashboard views, alert routing, containment guardrails, and audit logs. The CDO team also deploys and operates the Lambda container hosting infrastructure (VPC, subnets, Lambda execution roles, reserved concurrency, DynamoDB-based idempotency stores, and S3-based audit logs) for hosting the AIOps-provided AI Engine. In the default scheduled batch workflow, the central Step Functions orchestrator coordinates the programmatic flow by calling `/v1/detect` to initiate synchronous anomaly detection, executing `/v1/decide` to generate Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and dry-run Action Plans, and executing `/v1/verify` to evaluate remediation results. Manual or policy-driven rollbacks are registered via `/v1/audit/{audit_id}/rollback` to notify AIOps of the rollback execution results after CDO has already executed the rollback using the cached Boto3 payload from `finops-rollback-cache`, while `/v1/status/{id}` is used to check remediation or self-healing status (not detection polling). Note that these represent logical contract semantics physically exposed via the private internal ALB/HTTPS adapter; no physical API Gateway is deployed in the baseline batch pipeline. Workloads are run as serverless container image executions on AWS Lambda, and SQS/DLQ are used only for alert routing retry buffers rather than the detection flow. AIOps owns the Lambda-compatible AI Engine container image, model code, detection logic, explanation text, and backtest metrics.

The AIOps team owns any synthetic historical dataset used to train, enhance, calibrate, or backtest the anomaly model. The CDO documentation treats that dataset as upstream model-quality input, not as a CDO platform sizing source or operational data source. CDO consumes the model through a signed API contract, sends CUR and Cost Explorer data alongside CloudWatch `resource_utilization_metrics` (CPU, memory, network, disk, database connections, and GPU metrics to detect idle resources or runaway clusters), persists the returned decision evidence, and proves that alerting and containment policies are applied safely.

For Finance stakeholders, success means the dashboard can answer four questions without SQL: what changed, which account or squad owns it, how confident the platform is, and what action is allowed. For CDO reviewers, success means every scheduled run has a traceable input window, idempotency key, AI Engine contract version, alert decision, containment mode, and audit record.

### 1.1 Programmatic Contract Mapping (v1.3.0)

To integrate with the shared anomaly detection contracts, this CDO platform maps the logical interfaces to serverless Lambda execution components as follows:

| Endpoint / Interface | Source Contract | CDO Target Design & Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/detect` | `ai-api-contract.md` | Initiates synchronous batch anomaly detection. CDO invokes the private AI Engine endpoint `/v1/detect` via the private ALB with CUR cost data by default (or Cost Explorer daily data when `telemetry_delay_event = true` is activated as fallback), returning `success`, `correlation_id`, `anomalies_detected`, `anomalies_list`, and `data_confidence` (HIGH/LOW). Supports an optional `callback_url` for additive callback notification (does not replace the synchronous response). |
| `GET /v1/status/{id}` | `ai-api-contract.md` | Retrieves remediation/self-healing status for a given anomaly_id or audit_id. (No longer used for polling detection status). |
| `POST /v1/decide` | `ai-api-contract.md` | Requests RCA, recommended actions, and CLI dry-run payloads. CDO maps separate Finance (read-only) and Engineering (remediation/action plan) payloads. |
| `POST /v1/verify` | `ai-api-contract.md` | Evaluates remediation outcome using post-action metrics. Triggers locked containment if error budget burnt > 1%. |
| `POST /v1/audit/{audit_id}/rollback` | `ai-api-contract.md` | Rollback result notification interface. Records rollback execution outcome after CDO has already executed the rollback from the cached Boto3 payload, updating the tenant's error budget metrics. |
| `resource_utilization_metrics` | `telemetry-contract.md` | Hybrid cost and performance inputs including CPU (sent as raw 24-hourly `cpu_utilization_hourly` array; AI Engine computes idle continuous hours), memory, net, disk, database connections, and GPU metrics. Fallback to CUR-only mode (data_confidence: LOW, dry-run/alert only) when CloudWatch metrics are missing. |
| Secure Ingress & Identity | `telemetry-contract.md` | Signatures verified via AWS IAM SigV4 (`Authorization`), payload integrity hash (`X-Payload-SHA256`), tenant isolation (`X-Tenant-Id`), replay protection window skew < 300s (`X-Request-Timestamp`), and idempotency locks (`X-Idempotency-Key`). |
| Per-CDO Deployment | `deployment-contract.md` | The AI engine is provided as an ECR container image. This CDO deploys its own endpoint hosted on AWS Lambda Container, isolated by tenant contexts, and governed by Bedrock/budget limit alarms. |

## 2. Infra non-functional requirements

The CDO platform must meet the following non-functional requirements (NFRs) to ensure operational readiness:

| NFR | Target | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduled processing cadence | 24h default | Defends trade-off between CUR/Cost Explorer data availability, operational cost, and false-positive control. |
| Availability | ≥99.5% for scheduled run workflows and dashboards | Ensures consistent execution of the cost inspection pipeline. |
| Auditability | ≥90 days retention, append-only logs for containment | Mandatory client requirement for compliance and traceback. |
| Dashboard readability | Finance-friendly UI, zero SQL knowledge required | CFO's team must understand cost anomalies without technical queries. |
| Cost per run | Minimize; tracked with `Evidence needed: CDO pipeline run costs` | Ensures the platform itself is cost-effective. |
| Security baseline | IAM least-privilege, multi-account read-only access | Core boundary: NEVER terminate prod, delete data, or modify IAM. |
| AI Engine hosting uptime | ≥99.5% availability for the hosted model functions | CDO-hosted AI Engine Lambda container behind a private Application Load Balancer (ALB) must be reliable for secure private HTTPS execution. |
| Cost data contract coverage | CUR + Cost Explorer + CloudWatch resource_utilization_metrics (cpu_percent, memory_mib, network_in_bytes, network_out_bytes, disk_io_ops, database_connections, gpu_utilization, cpu_utilization_hourly) | Ensures CDO sends cost details along with CloudWatch metrics for anomaly detection (supporting idle_resource and runaway_usage patterns), with a fallback to CUR-only mode (data_confidence: LOW) when metrics are missing. |
| Idempotency | One accepted run per account and cost window | Prevents duplicate alerts, duplicate AI Engine calls, and double-counted dashboard materializations. |
| Alert explainability | Every anomaly alert includes confidence, severity, evidence window, owner route, and explanation | Finance and Engineering must be able to decide whether the alert is valid and what to do next. |
| Containment safety | Prod limited to tag, suggest, or dry-run; non-prod actions require policy approval | Keeps automation useful without crossing the client hard boundary. |

The NFRs are intentionally written as operational targets, not only architecture preferences. The CDO platform can pass the capstone only if it can prove that the daily workflow ran, that the AI Engine was invoked through the agreed contract, that model outputs were validated before use, and that every recommended action is auditable for at least 90 days.

## 3. Differentiation angle (KEY)

- **Angle chosen**: Lakehouse-centric FinOps control plane with serverless orchestration and CDO-hosted AI Engine on AWS Lambda container images.
- **Why this angle**: Production FinOps follows a natural 24h cadence based on CUR data export intervals. Ingesting CUR and Cost Explorer API data into a lakehouse (S3 + Glue + Athena) allows for structured historical query access, auditability, and finance-friendly materialized views. The AI Engine is hosted as a Lambda container image deployed via ECR behind a private Application Load Balancer (ALB). To optimize costs and operational overhead, the platform uses serverless compute (no idle cluster costs), SQS/DLQ queues for alert delivery retry buffering, private HTTPS API requests to the ALB target group for execution, and Lambda reserved concurrency as the default guardrail (with Provisioned Concurrency as an optional production optimization). This private internal network endpoint approach minimizes fixed runtime costs while ensuring secure internal access.
- **Trade-off accepted**: Cold-start latency of Lambda container image functions (typically 1-5 seconds during container pull and initialization), compared to always-on VMs. This is accepted because the 24h cadence does not require sub-second synchronous API response times, and synchronous execution requires the AI Engine Lambda to finish within the Lambda execution timeout limits, avoiding status polling complexity.
- **Lock date**: 2026-06-23 (enforcing W11 design lock).

The differentiation is not "use AI for FinOps"; that ownership belongs to AIOps. The CDO differentiation is the control plane around the AI decision: repeatable data pulls, queryable historical evidence, versioned model invocation, safe routing, policy-enforced containment, and finance-readable reporting. A purely dashboard-centric approach would show spend but not close the loop. A purely automation-centric approach would act too aggressively without enough evidence. The chosen angle keeps the daily FinOps loop measurable and reversible.

The integration contract reinforces this angle. CDO normalizes AWS billing inputs before invoking the AI Engine, keeps the model invocation versioned, and records enough evidence for Finance and Engineering to understand the decision path. AIOps can improve the model independently, while CDO keeps the operational loop stable.

## 4. CDO vs AIOps responsibility split

The responsibility boundary between the CDO and AIOps teams is defined as follows:

| Responsibility | CDO | AIOps |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest cost data (CUR, Cost Explorer API) | Owns | |
| Normalize cost windows & schema validation | Owns | |
| Tag metadata & resource ownership resolution | Owns | |
| Orchestration workflow (Step Functions) | Owns | |
| Run state, idempotency & scheduling | Owns | |
| Finance-friendly dashboard views (S3 + CloudFront dashboard backed by Athena/DynamoDB summaries) | Owns | |
| Alert routing (Finance vs. Engineering channels) | Owns | |
| Safe containment guardrails & audit log trail | Owns | |
| Lambda Container Platform hosting AI Engine (VPC integration, Execution Roles, Reserved Concurrency) | Owns | |
| Lambda concurrency controls (Reserved / Provisioned Concurrency, SQS/DLQ configuration) | Owns | |
| Deployment pipelines (ECR image digest pinning, Lambda alias routing, IaC) for AI workloads | Owns | |
| Runtime monitoring & concurrency control (Lambda reserved concurrency, CloudWatch logs, and X-Ray) | Owns | |
| AI Engine model internals, logic & code | | Owns |
| Model training, retraining & hyperparameter selection | | Owns |
| Confidence scoring & anomaly classification logic | | Owns |
| Explanatory text & natural language summaries | | Owns |
| Model versioning & artifact publishing | | Owns |
| AI model backtest performance and metrics | | Owns |
| Versioned container artifacts (images, weights, configs) | | Provides |

*Note: The CDO team consumes the AI Engine through a versioned programmatic contract (ai-api-contract.md v1.4.0) via private HTTPS requests to the ALB target group (representing `/v1/detect`, `/v1/status/{id}`, `/v1/decide`, `/v1/verify`, and `/v1/audit/{audit_id}/rollback` endpoints) with AWS SigV4 authentication. The responsibility split is defined such that CDO owns the hosting infrastructure (VPC, subnets, private ALB, Lambda container function, execution roles, reserved concurrency, SQS/DLQ queues for alerts, DynamoDB-based idempotency store `finops-idempotency-{env}`, and DynamoDB-based rollback cache `finops-rollback-cache`), while AIOps owns the Lambda-compatible AI Engine container image, model code, detection logic, explanation text, and backtest metrics. Telemetry includes CUR, Cost Explorer, and CloudWatch `resource_utilization_metrics` (CPU, memory, network, disk, database connections, and GPU metrics), with a fallback to CUR-only mode (data_confidence: LOW) if CloudWatch is unavailable.*

*Note on Contract Wording*: The signed contracts (`deployment-contract.md` v1.3.0, `ai-api-contract.md` v1.4.0) assume generic Task Force deployment configurations (which may mention ECS Fargate, App Runner, or Lambda). This CDO platform maps the ECR container image provided by AIOps to AWS Lambda Container hosting behind a private ALB. Outdated/generic compute targets in the contracts are treated as reference targets, but the private ALB front-end conforms to the required HTTP `/v1/*` contract endpoints.

The boundary is enforced at runtime as well as in documentation. CDO validates the `/v1/detect` request and response schema before each compatible release, records the model version returned by AIOps, persists the evidence URI for every anomaly, and fails closed when the AI Engine is unavailable or returns an invalid payload. AIOps remains accountable for model quality metrics such as precision, recall, confidence calibration, and explanation logic, while CDO remains accountable for whether those outputs are used safely in alerting, dashboarding, and containment workflows.

The minimum AI decision output consumed by CDO is: `run_id`, `model_version`, `anomaly_id`, `tenant/account`, `anomaly_type`, `confidence`, `severity`, `expected_spend`, `actual_spend`, `delta`, `evidence_window`, `explanation`, `recommended_route`, `recommended_containment_mode`, and `evidence_uri`. Missing required fields block containment and create an operator alert.

### 4.1 Service Level Objectives (SLO) Contract Compliance

The CDO platform consumes the AI Engine API according to the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) defined in `ai-api-contract.md` §6. The integration must be verified and monitored against the following contract-mandated targets:

| SLO Metric | Contract Target | Verification Event |
|---|---|---|
| **P99 Latency `/v1/detect`** | < 300 ms | Roundtrip processing time of POST `/v1/detect` requests in CloudWatch. |
| **P99 Latency `/v1/decide`** | < 500 ms | Processing latency of `/v1/decide` request. |
| **P99 Latency `/v1/verify`** | < 500 ms | Processing latency of `/v1/verify` request. |
| **LLM Inference SLA** | < 30 seconds | Amazon Bedrock (Nova LLM) execution window and database write. |
| **System Availability** | >=99.5% | Total availability of the private HTTPS ALB API endpoints. |
| **Error Rate (5xx)** | < 0.5% | System error responses (HTTP 5xx) relative to total requests. |

Any violation of these SLA parameters triggers the fallback runbook (SRE alerting, static rules, or failing closed for containment decisions).

## 5. Constraints

- **AWS only**: No multi-cloud architectures. All services must deploy in `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Synthetic model data is AIOps-owned**: Historical synthetic datasets used for model training, enhancement, or backtesting are owned by AIOps. CDO may reference AIOps-provided metrics, but must not claim ownership of the model dataset.
- **Backtest target**: The AI Engine must achieve a precision of ≥80% and a false-positive rate of ≤10% over a 3-month historical test period. CDO stores these metrics as integration evidence.
- **Cadence**: 24h scheduled batch processing.
- **NEVER terminate prod, NEVER delete data, NEVER modify IAM**: Absolute hard safety boundaries. Any auto-containment action on production resources is strictly prohibited. Production actions are limited to: tag, suggest, or dry-run.
- **Dry-run mode**: Mandatory for all containment patterns across all environments.
- **Audit trail**: Required for every containment proposal or execution, with a minimum retention period of 90 days.
- **Dashboard accessibility**: Visual dashboard tailored for Finance stakeholders without requiring SQL knowledge.
- **Code freeze**: Wednesday W12.
- **CDO demo data**: CDO may use synthetic anomaly injections for integration smoke tests, dashboard demonstrations, and containment dry-runs only. These demo events are not AI training evidence.
- **Region**: Primary implementation target is `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Containment scope**: At least one non-prod containment path may be implemented, but prod containment remains tag/suggest/dry-run only regardless of anomaly confidence.
- **Measurement honesty**: Unmeasured run cost, dashboard latency, alert delivery latency, AI inference latency, and actual precision results must remain marked as `Evidence needed: ...` until the team captures evidence.

These constraints define what the CDO platform must not do. The system is allowed to detect, explain, route, tag, suggest, and simulate containment. It is not allowed to become an unrestricted cleanup bot, a billing-data exfiltration path, or an IAM automation tool.

## 6. Open questions
